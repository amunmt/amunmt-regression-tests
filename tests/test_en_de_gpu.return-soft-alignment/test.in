Obama receives Netanyahu
the relationship between Obama and Netanyahu is not exactly friendly .
the two wanted to talk about the implementation of the international agreement and about Teheran &apos;s destabilising activities in the Middle East .
the meeting was also planned to cover the conflict with the Palestinians and the disputed two state solution .
relations between Obama and Netanyahu have been strained for years .
Washington criticises the continuous building of settlements in Israel and accuses Netanyahu of a lack of initiative in the peace process .
the relationship between the two has further deteriorated because of the deal that Obama negotiated on Iran &apos;s atomic programme , .
in March , at the invitation of the Republicans , Netanyahu made a controversial speech to the US Congress , which was partly seen as an affront to Obama .
the speech had not been agreed with Obama , who had rejected a meeting with reference to the election that was at that time impending in Israel .
in 911 Call , Professor admits to Shooting Girlfriend
in a 911 call , his voice only slightly shaky , college professor Shannon Lamb told police he had shot his girlfriend and officers needed to get over to their house .
lamb made a point to say his `` sweet dog &apos;&apos; was there alive and probably upset , and said the dead woman &apos;s family contacts could be found on her phone .
inside the home , officers found Amy Prentiss &apos; body and a hand-written note scribbled on a white legal pad : `` I am so very sorry I wish I could take it back I loved Amy and she is the only woman who ever loved me , &apos;&apos; read the letter authorities say was signed by Lamb .
there was no indication that Lamb , who was teaching two online classes for Delta State University in Cleveland , Mississippi , had already traveled 300 miles to the school &apos;s campus , where police believe he shot and killed a well-liked history professor , Ethan Schmidt , in the doorway to his office .
Delta State University police chief Lynn Buford said university officials heard about the shooting at 10 : 18 a.m .
he said Lamb made the fateful 911 call sometime after that .
by the end of the day , there would be one more death : lamb took his own life as police closed in on him .
a day after the school shooting forced students and faculty to hide behind locked doors , authorities were still trying to piece together what motivated Lamb .
the details released by investigators at both ends of the state as well as students and staff who knew him helped paint a picture of a talented but possibly troubled teacher .
students said they looked forward to his class .
police in Gautier , where Prentiss died , said he had no history of violence or criminal record .
Schmidt himself had included Lamb in a book he wrote where he acknowledged the `` wonderful people &apos;&apos; he shared his academic life with .
both taught in the Division of Social Sciences and History , which lists 17 faculty members , and many students took courses from both .
at the same time , there were some inclinations of problems .
a student who praised Lamb , Brandon beavers , said he also seemed agitated and jittery , `` like there was something wrong with him . &apos;&apos;
another student , Mikel Sykes , said Lamb told him he was dealing with stress at the end of the 2014-15 academic year .
lamb had earlier asked Delta State University for a medical leave of absence , saying he had a health issue of some sort .
this year , he was only teaching two online classes .
recent changes in the university &apos;s hiring policies meant that the doctorate Lamb had worked so hard to earn would not guarantee him an automatic tenure track to become an assistant professor .
University President William LaForge said he did n&apos;t know of any conflict between Lamb and Schmidt but `` obviously there was something in Mr. Lamb &apos;s mind . &apos;&apos;
those are questions Lamb can no longer answer .
after fleeing the campus , police later picked up Lamb &apos;s trail when he crossed back into Mississippi from Arkansas .
before he could be apprehended , Lamb killed himself with a single .38-caliber pistol in the backyard of a home about a mile south of his parents &apos; home on the outskirts of Greenville , Mississippi , said Washington County Coroner Methel Johnson .
his car was still running in the driveway .
it was not immediately clear why Lamb went to that home , though Johnson said she believes he knew the people who lived there .
lamb grew up in the area .
lamb started working at the university , which has 3,500 students in a city of about 12,000 , in 2009 and taught geography and education classes .
he received a doctorate in education in the spring .
one of Lamb &apos;s longtime friends described him as smart , charismatic and funny .
Carla Hairston said she was 15 and Lamb was 20 when they met through mutual friends .
she and her friends were in high school , and he was the cool older guy who tried for several years to teach her to play guitar .
he was quite the heartthrob back then .
all the girls would melt when he was around , &apos;&apos; said Hairston , now 40 and living in the Jackson suburb of Brandon .
lamb and Prentiss had apparently been dating for some time .
in the 911 call , Lamb said `` I killed my wife , &apos;&apos; but there was no record of them ever marrying .
they had a dog named Lightning that lived with them at the brick house that backs up to a bayou in Gautier .
police said the dog was OK .
Prentiss &apos; ex-husband , Shawn O&apos;Steen , said they divorced 15 years ago but remained friends and had a daughter who &apos;s now 19 .
`` She was completely devastated , &apos;&apos; O&apos;Steen said of his daughter .
she and her mother were absolutely best friends .
O&apos;Steen said he had not met Lamb but heard through his daughter Abigail that Lamb was interested in music and played the blues .
lamb met Prentiss when he and Abigail both performed at a summer fair three years ago .
later , they played together in the occasional gig .
O&apos;Steen said his daughter writes and sings her own music .
Prentiss was a nurse who worked for various companies online .
Mike Shaffer , a bartender and sometimes entertainment coordinator at The Julep Room , a dimly lit bar near Gautier , said he last saw Lamb and Prentiss the night of Sept . 5 , after Lamb had finished playing his guitar and harmonica for a sparse crowd .
there was no sign of anything amiss .
`` Just a happy couple , &apos;&apos; he said .
we were cutting up and throwing one-liners at each other .
I mean , they both had a good sense of wit about them .
Schmidt , the slain professor , directed the first-year seminar program and specialized in Native American and colonial history , said Don Allan Mitchell , an English professor at the school .
he was married and had three young children .
he studied at Emporia State University in Kansas and was president of his fraternity and student government .
on the Delta State campus in Cleveland on Tuesday night , about 900 people , including faculty members , staff , students , and members of the community , attended a candlelight memorial .
Schmidt &apos;s wife , Liz , and brother Jeff Schmidt also attended the vigil , during which the university choir sang `` Bright Morning Star &apos;&apos; and `` Amazing Grace . &apos;&apos;
classes resume Wednesday .
`` We &apos;re trying to get our students to come back , &apos;&apos; LaForge said .
the crisis is over .
this is a day of healing .
Amy and Rogelio Solis reported from Cleveland , Mississippi .
associated Press writers Emily Wagster Pettus in Greenville , Mississippi , and Rebecca Santana in New Orleans contributed to this report .
this story has been corrected to reflect that police are now saying Lamb made the 911 call after shooting Schmidt , and that while Lamb referred to Prentiss as his wife in the 911 call , there is no indication the two ever married .

UN Chief Says There Is No Military Solution in Syria
Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon says his response to Russia &apos;s stepped up military support for Syria is that `` there is no military solution &apos;&apos; to the nearly five-year conflict and more weapons will only worsen the violence and misery for millions of people .
the U.N. chief again urged all parties , including the divided U.N. Security Council , to unite and support inclusive negotiations to find a political solution .
ban told a news conference Wednesday that he plans to meet with foreign ministers of the five permanent council nations - the U.S. , Russia , China , Britain and France - on the sidelines of the General Assembly &apos;s ministerial session later this month to discuss Syria .
he expressed regret that divisions in the council and among the Syrian people and regional powers `` made this situation unsolvable . &apos;&apos;
ban urged the five permanent members to show the solidarity and unity they did in achieving an Iran nuclear deal in addressing the Syria crisis .
