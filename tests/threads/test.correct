in Biarritz , however , there is also a need for a little vision .
we , as MEPs , at least also have a duty to encourage them , despite all the odds , to make advances as the messages we get from the public in our countries .
looking back over recent events , I also think that the issue of petrol prices is particularly remarkable .
the Council is currently examining to what extent these mechanisms are included in Article 7 .
secondly , in terms of transparency for citizens , who are now aware of the rights they have with regard to European law and the creation and transparency of those who do exactly that , European law and European law .
I share his view on the key role that the Commission must also play in order to maintain the common general interest .
that is why I think it is very important that the chairman of the Euro Group , which we intend to create , plays its part fully in this area .
personally , I believe that the Convention method is so useful and that it should therefore be applied more often in future .
( DE ) Mr President , Mr President @-@ in @-@ Office of the Council , ladies and gentlemen , thank you for accepting my speech so favourably , and I would also like to thank those who have been generous enough to have kept this speech earlier .
we need to develop enhanced cooperation , make it simpler and more effective in order to achieve this result : enhanced cooperation as the most immediate , the easy way to move towards further integration , the need for which has been confirmed in many good speeches I have heard today .
the debate is closed .
in principle 10 , 11 and 15 are acceptable .
in view of the very technical nature of this problem , it is quite acceptable to reduce influence by Parliament , especially as the Commission is endeavouring to inform Parliament of its relevant specialist committees on projects to draw up new regulations .
for example , in France , the number of tax revenue varies depending on whether the Finance Ministry &apos;s statistics or national accounts are based .
policies aimed at rational , effective and safe transport should prioritise investment in a public rail network and not to standardise the conditions of competition between the road transport companies , which are above all to increase their private profit .
such buses will then have access to the country concerned , but they cannot operate in many places .
the report supports the approach taken by the Council and the Commission and stresses the need to introduce regulatory measures in a number of areas relating to pensions , cross @-@ border prospectuses and the Community patent .
the biggest problem associated with this new Charter is not its actual content but its legal status .
Mr President , I voted in favour of this Charter , not least because of the influence that our colleague Ingo Friedrich and Professor Herzog have placed on the content of this Charter .
the Charter as a political document is , in our view , a good starting point for this vital dialogue , which must now begin .
this would be a temporary solution which would have the effect of having a binding charter in a certain time .
the Charter goes well behind the European Convention on Human Rights , well behind the national conventions and conventions .
I voted against the possibility of including the Charter of Fundamental Rights before us .

for this reason , it must be clear that full compliance with the Copenhagen criteria is essential .
in this context , I welcome the work done by the European Parliament in the form of a report on each of the twelve candidate countries in the negotiations and an overall report by Mr Brok , to which I shall refer in particular during what I had to say .
I am thinking , of course , of the common agricultural policy and of regional development policies .
of course , it is not ruled out that , once again , the candidate countries have raised the issue of the timing of the enlargements once again - you have already referred to it , Mr President .
enlargement is a historic achievement .
but success does not only relate to the timing - important though it is .
if they are not implemented everywhere in Europe , they are put at risk everywhere .
chapters will be opened or closed , in line with the actual status of the preparations and the progress of the negotiations .
in the area of the internal market , we must take care to ensure that the transitional periods remain as limited as possible and as far as content is concerned .
we need political answers to political issues , which must be well communicated .
just imagine how the Kosovo and Bosnia @-@ Herzegovina problems or relations with Serbia would be resolved today at a time of the Cold War .
we should also begin discussions with our own people .
we will be able to support all this and also want to support it .
much of the fears in relation to enlargement are due to exaggerations , but in order to be able to address the populists responsible for this , we must have smart political arguments that convince people .
our group is calling for deadlines to be set at Nice or immediately after the Treaty of Nice in order to end the accession negotiations .
Mr President , our group , the Confederal Group of the European United Left / Nordic Green Left largely shares the considerations and findings contained in Mr Brok &apos;s report on enlargement , and we very much appreciate the efforts of this valuable report .
sixthly , we consider it a mistake to link enlargement into practice with the previous integration of these countries into NATO .
like many others this morning , I very much welcomed the statements made by President Prodi ; I have taken note of the statements made by Minister Moscovici , who , although with diplomacy , also pointed out that the current situation is not particularly optimistic with regard to the possible results of the next two or three months .
I would therefore ask the President @-@ in @-@ Office and the Commissioner to take due account of the length of their contributions .
I would draw the conclusion that this needs to be discussed more , but also in an appropriate and better way .
however , irrespective of this , I do not think it is inappropriate to raise this issue .
I do not want to let slip in the room , as has happened for many years in other areas of foreign aid .
the fact is , however , that , today , 3 October 2000 , I cannot tell you any country in the accession process when it will be ready for accession .
I can also tell them why , because these people wanted to be on the right side for all , that is , firmly anchored in the family of democratic nations .
thank you for that clarification , Commissioner .
in my opinion , it would have failed to fulfil her point of view .
now we can secure common values and benefits .
imagine if , in your own country , a fundamental , economic and social transformation has taken place in such a short space of time .
it is still hot air , Mr Verheugen , and there is still no sign of the concrete project promoters .
today , the macroeconomic situation has stabilised .
this issue needs to be made a special effort and , in my opinion , cannot be dealt with simply as a marginal issue for the accessions of Lithuania and Poland .
if , for example , we are able to call on the citizens who are able to move freely within the European Union to the candidate countries from the outset , if we want to delay the recognition of this right to the fundamental principles of the Union from the East , this means further erosion of support for the difficult reforms needed for accession .
I am pleased that the report was adopted unanimously in committee on 14 September .
my colleagues in the Committee on Foreign Affairs , Human Rights , Common Security and Defence Policy supported me in it - that the Czechs continue to apply the Copenhagen criteria , and I would like the Czechs themselves to check their own legal system when it has to be , side by side , to find out whether there are some things that are discriminatory .
now on the good news , because they are putting my critical comments into account in the background .
Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , I think I can say that , having debated and fleshed out in the Committee on Foreign Affairs and adopted unanimously in the Committee on Foreign Affairs and adopted unanimously , this report gives a clear description and analysis of the present phase of Hungary &apos;s journey towards accession .
we need to address this issue seriously , but within a global framework which includes not only Hungary but also the other candidate countries which have this obsolete and unsafe technology .
the suspicion of corruption is an extremely destructive force and must be stopped as a matter of urgency .
thanks to the active support of Commissioner Verheugen , the World Bank and the United Nations , the Romanian Government has given us the opportunity to introduce exemplary principles and best practices in the region .
this is a candidate country in which a third of the territory has been occupied by the Turkish army since 1974 and in which the basic principles of the European Union do not apply throughout its territory because of a particularly impenetrable demarcation line .
Europe must become a responsible player in resolving the Cyprus problem .
for Malta , it is essential to provide financial support in the framework of the pre @-@ accession strategy and the recognition that the aid granted to Malta should comply with the rules that apply to other candidate countries .
once the relevant conditions are met , neither the candidate countries nor the countries in the eurozone present should oppose the accession of the candidate countries to the third stage of economic and monetary union .
if you like , I am a representative of a region which , ten years ago , represented a piece of enlargement to the east , I lived beyond the Iron Curtain .
in the interests of a common information area , we must work together to make great efforts in this area .
there is clearly also a difference between East and West in the field of technology : 4 Internet connections per 1 000 inhabitants of Central and Eastern Europe are 16 of us .
in this situation , the German Democratic Republic was given massive financial assistance with West Germany , £ 150 billion a year .
in the next few years , we in Eastern Europe are threatened with depopulation of villages in rural areas , as well as a massive purchase of agricultural land to mechanical , productive holdings .
we are drawing up a compendium of directives and regulations on issues such as pollution , the emission of radioactive and other dangerous substances , waste disposal , water , air and soil quality , food safety and novel food and product liability , which are important for health .
in my opinion , therefore , my opinion is not just about what the candidate countries should do , but also of what the European Union must do .
but now to the right signals .
we must ensure that what is available on rail in Central and Eastern Europe is not replaced by road transport now and again , with a great deal of effort to put things right .
this &apos; no &apos; vote will be analysed very closely in the coming months .
we are working through the text and tried , on a number of points , to make some penalties .
the value of this enlargement should not , in any case , be called into question .
if a long transitional period is required in certain areas , then we should accept them .
first , the democratic desire of the states and peoples concerned to join the EU is to be respected .
they are mistaken because , with 80 000 pages of directives and regulations , the European Union will not create prosperity .
Denmark is demonstrating the increasing reservations that are being shown by our people and the recent rejection of the euro by Denmark .
the opinion of the Brok report , for which I had the responsibility and which was supported by the Committee on Budgets , comes to the same conclusion .
this is not the best time to address foreign policy issues and the mutual accusations of the different parties are sometimes exacerbated and manipulated .
if the EU rules were split into two , the achievement of the level of integration achieved by the current Member States would be ensured , on the one hand , and the deepening of their cooperation , on the other .
I visited Romania at the end of July to see for myself the functioning of one of the largest orphanages in northern Romania .
for example , we ask the rapporteur , the Commission and the Council to complement the agricultural policy part of the fisheries policy , for example , by referring to the &apos; agricultural aspects of enlargement &apos; , the &apos; agricultural policy aspects &apos; .
better later and well than earlier and bad .
thanks to the close relations between Cyprus and the people of the Eastern Mediterranean , the accession of the island will increase the presence of Europe in this very important area .
I support the rapporteur &apos;s view that Malta should be included in the first round of enlargement and that the negotiations should be completed at the end of 2001 .
it is also our responsibility to communicate enlargement to speeches and acts of action .
in this context , it is important to create a positive picture of enlargement .
the consideration of Mr Verheugen , a referendum on enlargement , has been thrown out , and the reason is obvious : the owners will not be able to decide on it .
in view of the double challenge that Europe should be able to reconcile itself , and the institutional reform aimed at strengthening democracy and efficiency in its institutions , the European Union is , as so often , at a significant turning point in its history .
I would like to focus on the Council , which is unfortunately absent , but I would like to express certain expectations and concerns .
this dialogue would also help to create the necessary administrative capacity for the effective governance of the country , by creating the structures that are not yet available today and the levels of corruption being reduced .
Malta , like the other smaller Member States , should be represented by at least six Members .
nor can we assume that some applicants are , of course , the first candidate and could not even start enlargement at all .
we can only hope that the great efforts that the government has just made will be reflected in the Commission &apos;s next report .
