in Biarritz , however , there is also a need for a little vision .
we , as MEPs , at least also have a duty to encourage them , despite all the odds , to make advances as the messages we get from the public in our countries .
bearing in mind the events of recent times , the issue of petrol prices also seems to me to be particularly remarkable .
the Council is currently examining to what extent these mechanisms are included in Article 7 .
secondly , in terms of transparency for citizens , who are now aware of the rights they have with regard to European law and the creation and transparency of those who do exactly that , European law and European law .
I share his view on the key role that the Commission must also play in order to maintain the common general interest .
I therefore think it is very important that the President of the Euro Group , which we intend to create , should play his role fully in this area .
I personally believe that precisely that is why the Convention method is so useful and that it should therefore be used more frequently in future .
Mr President , Mr President @-@ in @-@ Office of the Council , ladies and gentlemen , thank you for accepting my speech so favourably , and I would also like to thank those who have wisely accused me that I did not have this speech before .
we need to develop enhanced cooperation , make it simpler and more effective in order to achieve this result : enhanced cooperation as the most immediate , the easy way to move towards further integration , the need for which has been confirmed in many good speeches I have heard today .
the debate is closed .
in principle 10 , 11 and 15 are acceptable .
in view of the highly technical nature of this issue , it is quite acceptable to reduce influence by Parliament , especially as the Commission is endeavouring to inform Parliament of its relevant specialist committees on projects to draw up new regulations .
for example , in France , the number of tax revenue varies depending on whether the Finance Ministry &apos;s statistics or national accounts are based .
in order to achieve a rational , effective and safe transport management policy , the priority should be to invest in a public rail network and not to standardise the conditions of competition between the road haulage companies , which are above all to increase their private profit .
such buses will then have access to the country concerned , but they are practically non @-@ existent .
the report supports the approach taken by the Council and the Commission and stresses the need to introduce regulatory measures in a number of areas relating to pensions , cross @-@ border prospectuses and the Community patent .
the biggest problem associated with this new Charter does not concern its actual content , but its legal status .
Mr President , I voted in favour of this Charter , not least because of the influence that our colleague Ingo Friedrich and Professor Herzog have placed on the content of this Charter .
the Charter as a political document is , in our view , a good starting point for this vital dialogue , which must now begin .
this would be a transitional solution which would allow for a binding charter in a certain time .
the Charter goes well behind the European Convention on Human Rights , well behind the national conventions and conventions .
I voted against the possibility of including the Charter of Fundamental Rights before us .
( A5 @-@ 0244 / 2000 ) by Mr Wiersma on Slovakia &#91; COM ( 1999 ) 5@@ 11 - C5 @-@ 0034 / 2000 - 1997 / 23@@ 173 ( COS ) &#93; ;
for this reason , it must be clear that full compliance with the Copenhagen criteria is essential .
in this context , I welcome the work done by the European Parliament in the form of a report on each of the twelve candidate countries in the negotiations and an overall report by Mr Brok , to which I shall refer in particular during what I had to say .
I am thinking , of course , of the common agricultural policy and of regional development policies .
of course , it is not ruled out that the candidate countries should take this opportunity , once again - you have already referred to it , Mr President - to raise the question of the timing of enlargement .
enlargement is a historic achievement .
but success does not only relate to the timing - important though it is .
if they are not implemented everywhere in Europe , they are put at risk everywhere .
chapters will be opened or closed , in line with the actual status of the preparations and the progress of the negotiations .
in the area of the internal market , we must take care to ensure that the transitional periods remain as limited and as limited as possible .
we need political answers to political issues , which must be well communicated .
just imagine how the Kosovo and Bosnia @-@ Herzegovina problems or relations with Serbia would be resolved today at a time of the Cold War .
we should also begin discussions with our own people .
we will be able to support all this and also want to support it .
much of the fears in relation to enlargement stem from exaggerations , but in order to be able to address the populists responsible for this , we must have smart political arguments that convince people .
our group is calling for deadlines to be set at Nice or immediately after the Treaty of Nice in order to end the accession negotiations .
Mr President , our group , the Confederal Group of the European United Left / Nordic Green Left largely shares the considerations and findings contained in Mr Brok &apos;s report on enlargement , and we very much appreciate the efforts of this valuable report .
sixthly , we consider it a mistake to link enlargement in practice with the previous integration of these countries into NATO .
like many others this morning , I very much welcomed the statements made by President Prodi ; I have taken note of the statements made by Minister Moscovici , who has also pointed to us , albeit diplomatically , to the fact that the current situation is not particularly optimistic with regard to the possible results of the next two or three months .
I therefore ask the President @-@ in @-@ Office and the Commissioner to take due account of the length of their contributions .
I would draw the conclusion that this needs to be discussed more , but also in an appropriate and better way .
however , irrespective of this , I do not think it is inappropriate to raise this issue .
I do not want to let slip into the trap that has existed for many years in other areas of foreign aid .
however , the fact is that , today , 3 October 2000 , I cannot tell you any country in the accession process when it will be ready for accession .
I can also tell them the reason why , because these people wanted to be on the right side , they are firmly anchored in the family of democratic nations .
thank you for that clarification , Commissioner .
in my view , she would not have met her brief and would have missed her point .
now we can secure common values and benefits .
imagine if , in your own country , a fundamental , economic and social transformation has taken place in such a short space of time .
it is still hot air , Mr Verheugen , and there is still no sign of the concrete project promoters .
today , the macroeconomic situation has stabilised .
this issue needs to be made a special effort and , in my opinion , cannot be dealt with simply as a marginal issue for the accessions of Lithuania and Poland .
for example , if we consider the possibility that citizens , the workers of the candidate countries can move freely in the European Union from the outset , if we want to delay the recognition of this right to the fundamental principles of the Union from the East , this means further erosion of support for the difficult reforms needed for accession .
I am pleased that the report was adopted unanimously in committee on 14 September .
my colleagues in the Committee on Foreign Affairs , Human Rights , Common Security and Defence Policy supported me in it - that the Czechs continue to apply the Copenhagen criteria , and I would like the Czechs themselves to check their own legal system when it has to be , side by side , to find out whether there are some things that are discriminatory .
and now on the good news , because they are putting my critical comments into account in the background .
Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , I think I can say that , having discussed and fleshed out in the Committee on Foreign Affairs and adopted unanimously in the Committee on Foreign Affairs , this report gives a clear description and analysis of the present phase of Hungary &apos;s journey towards accession in two respects .
we need to address this issue seriously , but within a global framework which includes not only Hungary but also the other candidate countries which have this obsolete and unsafe technology .
the suspicion of corruption is an extremely destructive force and must be stopped as a matter of urgency .
thanks to the active support of Commissioner Verheugen , the World Bank and the United Nations , the Romanian Government has given us the opportunity to introduce exemplary principles and best practices in the region .
this is a candidate country in which a third of the territory has been occupied by the Turkish army since 1974 and in which the basic principles of the European Union do not apply throughout its territory because of a particularly impenetrable demarcation line .
Europe must become a responsible player in resolving the Cyprus problem .
for Malta , it is essential to provide financial support in the framework of the pre @-@ accession strategy , as well as an awareness that the aid to Malta should comply with the rules that apply to other candidate countries .
once the relevant conditions are met , neither the candidate countries nor the countries in the eurozone present have any reason to oppose the accession of candidate countries to the third stage of economic and monetary union .
if you like , I am a representative of a region that ten years ago , represented a piece of enlargement to the east , I lived beyond the Iron Curtain .
in the interests of a common information area , we must work together to make great efforts in this area .
there is no doubt that there are still differences in the area of technology between East and West : 4 Internet connections per 1 000 inhabitants of Central and Eastern Europe are 16 of us .
in this situation , the German Democratic Republic was given massive financial assistance with West Germany , £ 150 billion a year .
in the next few years , in Eastern Europe , there is a threat to the depopulation of villages in rural areas and a massive purchase of agricultural land to mechanical , productive holdings .
we are drawing up a compendium of directives and regulations on issues such as pollution , the emission of radioactive and other dangerous substances , waste disposal , water , air and soil quality , food safety and novel food and product liability , which are important for health .
in my opinion , therefore , my opinion is not just about what the candidate countries should do , but also of what the European Union must do .
but now to the right signals .
we must make sure that what is present in central and eastern Europe is not replaced by road transport , now it is not replaced by road transport and , afterwards again , with a great deal of effort to put things right .
this &apos; no &apos; vote will be analysed very closely in the coming months .
we are working through the text and tried , on a number of points , to make some penalties .
there should be no doubt as to the value , including the full @-@ material value of this enlargement in the public .
if a long transitional period is required in certain areas , then we should accept them .
first , the democratic desire of the states and peoples concerned to join the EU is to be respected .
they are mistaken because , with 80 000 pages of directives and regulations , the European Union will not create prosperity .
Denmark is demonstrating the increasing reservations that are being shown by our people and the recent rejection of the euro by Denmark .
the opinion of the Brok report , for which I had the responsibility and which was supported by the Committee on Budgets , comes to the same conclusion .
this is not the best time to address foreign policy issues and the mutual accusations of the different parties are sometimes exacerbated and manipulated .
if the EU rules were split into two , we could , on the one hand , safeguard the level of integration achieved in the present Member States and , on the other , promote the deepening of their cooperation .
I visited Romania at the end of July to see for myself the functioning of one of the largest orphanages in northern Romania .
for example , we ask the rapporteur , the Commission and the Council to complement the agricultural policy part of the fisheries policy , for example , by referring to the &apos; agricultural aspects &apos; of the enlargement and fisheries policy aspects of enlargement .
better later and well than earlier and bad .
thanks to the close relations between Cyprus and the people of the Eastern Mediterranean , the accession of the island will increase the presence of Europe in this very important area .
I support the rapporteur &apos;s view that Malta should be included in the first round of enlargement and that the negotiations should be completed at the end of 2001 .
it is our responsibility , too , to communicate enlargement through speeches and through action .
in this context , it is important to create a positive picture of enlargement .
the point made by Mr Verheugen , a referendum on enlargement , has been thrown out , and the reason is obvious : the owners will not be able to decide on it .
in view of the double challenge that Europe should be able to reconcile itself , and the institutional reform intended to strengthen democracy and efficiency in its institutions , the European Union - as so often - is at a significant turning point in its history .
I would like to focus my remarks on the Council , which is unfortunately absent , but I would like to express a number of expectations and concerns .
this dialogue would also help to create the necessary administrative capacity for the effective governance of the country , by creating the structures that are not yet available today and the levels of corruption being reduced .
Malta , like the other smaller Member States , should be represented by at least six Members .
nor can we assume that some people are , of course , the first candidate and could not , without him , begin enlargement at all .
we can only hope that the great efforts that the government has just made recently will be reflected in the Commission &apos;s next report .
Romania , too , can make it clear to our people that it is in our interest to stabilise Europe .
Mr President , I come from Sweden , a country where there is still a great deal of scepticism about the EU project .
the texts tabled by the Committee on the Environment , Public Health and Food Safety in the Brok report are necessary steps for this , and they are a prerequisite for confronting the slowdown in European environmental policy .
the SAPARD programme is a good opportunity to do this , and I very much welcome the fact that the Commission has already approved six programmes .
my group has already expressed its wish to conclude the first negotiations by 2003 , to allow accession by June 2004 .
I will now make the second @-@ minute speech on the subject of Slovenia .
Mr President , the comments made today by Mr Brok on a regulation in the nature of an EEA agreement as an alternative to the applicant countries , which fail to meet the Copenhagen criteria , has been relatively limited .
the applicant countries should also be encouraged to participate in the Community programmes for equal opportunities , especially those dealing with violence against women .
if , despite the recognised and positive attitude of the Turkish side , this should prove to be unattainable , then I do not think that the European Union should allow Cyprus to be hostage to Turkish intransigence , and to embark on the immediate inclusion of the Republic of Cyprus , which would like to become a member of the Union in anticipation of the future membership of the entire country , as was the case with a founding member whose anniversary of the unification of which we are celebrating today .
approval of the Minutes of the previous sitting
I think it is also part of the relationship of the institutions that we should take care to ensure that this does not happen .
this is an important issue .
this is not the case .
that is what I support with my report .
a large proportion of the contamination or the spread of heavy metals before the environmental awareness was sufficiently advanced and before we knew what the impact would be .
I would like to suggest to the Commission a proposal on how to deal with this problem .
the crises of recent years have also become more sensitive to all of us .
that is why the Group of the European People ’ s Party ( Christian Democrats ) and European Democrats is keen to ensure that there is effective control instruments , and we are working with the rapporteur to ensure that the Commission &apos;s regulatory experts are able to carry out unannounced checks on the ground , in close and constructive cooperation with the control authorities of the Member States .
we all want the same thing , and we have to say it here too .
there are contradictions in the heavy metals .
please bear in mind , ladies and gentlemen , that the legitimacy of our Community institutions lies in the fact that our legitimacy is based solely on the will of the nations that we are responsible for defending .
the Commission has now proposed that the derogations for compound feedingstuffs should be deleted and that a clear threat to it should be laid down below the ceiling of action .
tar , contaminants , poor breeding and inadequate hygiene will , sooner or later , result in sick animals and , as a result , even more diseases among the people .
these directives are part of the most fundamental and far @-@ reaching reform of Community legislation on food safety and hygiene over the last 25 years .
I should like to refer briefly to two problems in the declaration .
I would also say that what is going on in criminal terms is criminal .
farmers must , of course , be compensated for the destruction of untreated contaminated feed , as is the case , for example , of the slaughter of animals which are affected by TSEs .
however , I would first of all like to mention the amendments that the Commission cannot accept .
it is already before dioxins and PCBs and , as I have just said , this scientific risk assessment is expected to be presented in October .
it seeks to establish a framework for the exchange of information in the field of animal nutrition , the focus of which is to provide the rapid exchange of information and a legal basis for the adoption of monitoring measures for products produced within the Community .
under Directive 95 / 53 , Article 19 already contains a provision for the use of punishable penalties for punishable deterrence and for legal or criminal liability in the event of a court judgment .
once again the compound feed industry has tried to influence the Council and overturn the open declaration .
we need a positive list of permitted additives and ingredients in animal feed .
I believe that transparency will ultimately also increase competition , and that makes it more incentive to produce the best mixtures .
full transparency for the farmer is , in our view , necessary .
Mr President , Commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , as regards the composition of the animal feed , the whole question of the elimination of diet , lead , arsenic , DDT and other substances arises as a result of the marketing of this feed .
we must create a realistic framework .
Mr President , the present proposal and the rapporteur &apos;s opinion on this are a step in the right direction , but the weak structure , which has control at Community level , is , at the same time , still very clear .
I consider it absolutely necessary to reverse the burden of proof as proposed in Amendment No 4 .
finally , I should like to point out that the Commission rejects Amendment 6 because it does not fall within the scope of the directive .
at the time of the vote on these paragraphs , I will ask if there are any objections to their inclusion after paragraph 1 .
( Parliament approved the oral amendment ) ( Parliament adopted the resolution )
( Parliament adopted the resolution )
the second condition is that the candidate countries should continue to make good progress in the pre @-@ accession process in order to comply with the Copenhagen criteria and to take full account of the acquis communautaire of the European Union .
overall , in our opinion , the Brok report reflects completely the wrong or even a dangerous view of enlargement whereby the countries of Eastern Europe are to be made unilaterally prescribed by law , legislation and institutions of the European Union .
returning to the budgetary aspect , I believe that it is essential to examine the budgetary implications of the accession of such a large number of new Member States before the end of the current financial framework in 2006 .
3 . if the candidate countries are admitted to the EU they will have to be placed on an equal footing with all the other Member States , under no circumstances can we accept that new Member States should be treated as second @-@ class members .
the reverse path is dividing farmers , endangering social development in the rural structures of Europe .
in fact , this report proposes the expansion of an economic market .
there is a risk both of the political weakening of the Union and of social dumping and , at the end of the day , the reduction of the European project to a large market and an area of free competition .
on paper , a great deal has been achieved in terms of equal treatment and equal opportunities for men and women , but what is the situation in practice ?
the enlargement of the European Union to include ten Eastern European countries , Malta and Cyprus is a big project .
secondly , enlargement inevitably requires a revision of the Financial Perspective of the European Union , which were drafted and decided at a time when the prospect of enlargement has not yet been highlighted .
Mr President , I am sincerely pleased that I voted for the report on Estonia &apos;s application for membership of the European Union .
in Latvia , progress is being made with regard to compliance with the Copenhagen criteria and the adoption of the acquis communautaire .
in Lithuania there is clear progress as regards compliance with the Copenhagen criteria and the adoption of the acquis communautaire .
furthermore , in Poland human rights and fundamental freedoms are fully respected .
Poland was treated far too long as the threatening battlefield of Poland ’ s threatening neighbour ; it was an involuntary arena for one of the most terrible tragedies of history , encouraged by a totalitarian regime that could breach its legendary spirit of resistance , but Poland has never stopped demonstrating freedom , courage and independence , all of which is essentially the common values on which our European political building is based .
if the Czech Republic continues to make good progress and the European Union has adapted its institutional structures and policies in order to cope with enlargement , I see no reason why the Czech Republic should not be included in the Union .
so a tribute to the Republic of Hungary .
if Bulgaria continues to make progress and the European Union has adapted its institutional structures and policies in order to cope with enlargement , I see no reason why Bulgaria should not be admitted into the Union .
I hope that we will be able to welcome Slovenia in the first group of new Members .
it addresses the issue of the return of refugees , as well as the problem of the settlement of Cyprus .
this is also evident from the conclusions of the Helsinki European Council , which finally states that the solution to the Cyprus question is not &apos; pre @-@ condition &apos; for accession .
we hope that the prospect of early accession of the EU and the simplification of contacts aimed at and which will be promoted and funded by the EU will have a positive influence on the resolution of the &apos; Cyprus issue &apos; .
the deliberate violations of health , criminal law and ethical rules as a result of the rape of laws on nature , respect for the species and the physicist of animals took place without any kind of control , appropriate rules or legitimate sanctions .
there is a real need for caution in this area , for animal nutrition is the first link in the food chain .
in view of the past , in view of the current economic relations between the major powers and poor Asian countries , the words of &apos; equal &apos; partners &apos; for the future are , at best , a pious hope , but a form of misleading exploitation via pseudo @-@ democratic rhetoric .
I would like to point out to the honourable Members that the Council working party unanimously decided to advise the Council to set up a joint action programme in the action programme with which a combination of the management and consultation procedures could increase the influence of each Member State .
I understand their concern , but the Commission has assured me that NGOs can also continue to apply for funding under this and other programmes and by initiatives from the Commission .
it is therefore essential that the groups listed in Article 13 should be effectively protected against discrimination .
fourthly : the participation of the social partners .
in the course of the public consultations on Article 13 , it became clear to me how urgent we need such a directive .
basically , insofar as the right to equal treatment is a fundamental human right and as such is the basis on which the European Union is founded .
nobody remains blind to the tight budgetary situation in category 3 , which is included in this and other programmes .
the derogation , for reasons that may be based on ideological , religious or age @-@ free , must be compatible with the right to the protection of certain public or private organisations and conscientious respect for the principle of equal treatment .
with regard to the more detailed details of the report , I would like to thank Mr Mann , who has taken over most of the proposals made by the Committee on Industry , Research and Energy and , in particular , the proposals on multiple discrimination which are subject to multiple discrimination against women in particular .
this was the case a few years ago , when the equal pay for women , equal opportunities and the improvement of maternity leave were on the agenda , and their comments were also discussed in the spring on combating racial discrimination .
this is also a sore point in our group , and it touches on the issue of pluralism .
I would also like to take this opportunity to congratulate Mr Cashman , because directives are important , but action programmes on their support are , of course , equally essential .
Mr President , Commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , both rapporteurs have done an excellent job , for which I would like to express my thanks on behalf of my group .
we are therefore very concerned and asked the Commission , when reviewing the use of these financial means , to ensure that Turkey does not claim that it would abolish or combat forms of discrimination , which are secondary , while not respecting the most important handicap , which is essentially the result of so much misfortune in our Europe .
joint and operational staff share this principle .
I believe that , in order to do this , we can only create more uncertainty because we no longer know who can actually support the Commission &apos;s programme accordingly .
Mr President , Commissioner , our group has made a positive assessment of the need for everyone to focus on the need to extend the scope of the action programme with a series of amendments which , in fact , led to a new system of discrimination , to ensure equal treatment for all persons , irrespective of gender , race , ethnic origin , religion or belief , age or sexual orientation .
the purpose of this work , on the basis of Article 13 , is to achieve equality of opportunity and , in doing so , to destroy the mask of the kindness hidden so often , especially at the workplace , of prejudice and bigotry .
criticism has been levelled at Article 5 in the present form because the text gives the impression that discrimination would be justified and not combated .
for forty years , however , there have been texts based on discrimination .
in general I agree with regard to discrimination stressing the importance of increased influence on education and culture ; in my opinion , even the culture of non @-@ discrimination must be defeated , by providing up @-@ to @-@ date information available to all citizens in all Member States .
Mr President , Commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , as we know , there is still a lot of discrimination in the European Union , especially in employment and in the profession , even though Article 13 of the Treaty on European Union prohibits them .
I welcome this directive as the first EU legislation to introduce pan @-@ European citizens for our 37 million disabled citizens , in order to put an end to the rules introduced by the back door to protect disabled people &apos;s rights and , at the same time , pay tribute to the disability movement , which has always fought for today &apos;s Day .
they vary from one Member State to another .
otherwise we will not be successful in the real world .
finally , the European Parliament must be kept informed , taking account of the reports and opinions it has prepared , and it is worth highlighting the need for , and the importance of , the opinion and participation of NGOs and associations , with the necessary resources , which will undoubtedly have a key role in the success of the measures adopted .
the provision , according to which exceptions for religion may be acceptable to essential professional requirements , cannot be accepted in my opinion .
the size of our common civilisation is the result of respect for the rules of the open , tolerant and liberal society , an inclusive and multicultural dynamic .
as you know , in November last year the Commission presented a comprehensive package on the basis of Article 13 , which included two directives and one programme .
to sum up , I can accept Amendments Nos 1 , 2 , 7 , 8 , 10 , 11 , 13 , 18 , 21 , 41 to 45 , 47 to 45 , 50 , 58 , 59 , 62 , 64 , 65 , 66 and 67 either in their current form or in principle .
I believe that these two additions to these two additions to the scope of the proposal will be clearer .
I would now like to focus on the amendments I cannot accept because they cause political or legal problems .
this directive must be part of the social acquis in the accession countries .
furthermore , many third countries have expressed their interest in participating in this code of conduct .
I very much welcome these developments .
I call on all governments to come up with just as transparent reports .
consequently , we are also opposed to the amendments tabled by our fellow Members calling for global disarmament , and the European Union should set an example .
the spread of light weapons still gives cause for concern , especially on our front doorstep , for example in the Balkans .
Sweden does not believe that the activities within the CFSP can be described as a defence policy , as they do not include mutual defence obligations as laid down in Section 5 of the NATO Treaty .
the European Code of Conduct contains detailed principles governing the export of conventional arms exports .
the European Union wants to tackle the destabilising concentration and spread of small arms and light weapons in many parts of the world .
I would like to thank the rapporteur again for his excellent report , which makes an important contribution to the development of our policy in this very important area .
this is to be achieved by putting the application of the criteria on the provision of this added value in a perspective that has both positive choice and housing .
but so far there has not been a hierarchy of hierarchy and exclusion .
Mr President , I should like to thank the Commissioner for the first part of his speech , but I have a couple of questions .
I am sure you will say that on account of your experience , that has already been said several times .
finally , I should like to respond to Mr Piétrasanta and thank him for his speech and his constructive spirit .
( EL ) Commissioner , thank you for coming here today and explaining this communication to us .
with regard to the issue of socio @-@ economic research , it is quite clear that this will be taken into account .
furthermore , I wish to express my concern at the very low level of funding for the cohesion funds at the end of August , which was just 16 % , and even though things have developed since the end of August , I would like to confirm that I am concerned and I have told this on 11 September of your House &apos;s Committee on Regional Policy and Transport .
forgive me for saying , but I believe , Commissioner , that you are not well informed .
could you give us the figures for Spain and Greece ?
this proposal , however , came up against fierce opposition from certain Member States .
if , though , the cost of fuel of such companies accounts for more than double the sum borne by the multinationals in other regions of Scotland and can also participate in these invitations to tender , this would seriously distort competition , to the detriment of communities in remote areas .
given the Community &apos;s obligation to meet the objectives of the Kyoto Protocol , I wonder if Mr Bolkestein realises that the best way to achieve this is to increase fuel taxes rather than increasing the other costs of transport .
if the Commission has no instruments to influence the level of excise duties in the Member States , and if the rules of competition do not permit a preference for certain sectors of the economy , then surely it is only a matter of a partial compensation in a region that is disadvantaged on the grounds of its peripheral and isolated remoteness , and not a special preference to collect different excise taxes in these very specific circumstances ?
these activities , however , do not include specific funding for minority languages , which does not prevent us from using the programmes for this purpose .
I would like to share with you the questions raised by Mr Sacrédeus and Mrs Theorin on the same subject .
I would like to know whether this issue has not been pushed back and forth between the various EU Commissioners without anyone at the end of the day having taken responsibility for this .
every year , over one million children are forced into prostitution .
as far as compensation is concerned , the Member States and the Commission are of the opinion that the public authorities and the local operators will be responsible for the costs of conversion in the relevant areas .
Mr President , a short answer , 11 countries have chosen the euro .
the hunters &apos; association would have the important task of ensuring that hunters have the necessary qualifications for such an assessment .
as regards France , the Commission expects information about the measures undertaken by the competent authorities in relation to some of the recommendations of the Food and Veterinary Office &apos;s inspection report , in particular with regard to measures to ensure that the line plans are properly followed and signed .
I would like to hear from the Commissioners a little more detail on the specific issue of infringement proceedings against Italy .
the Commission services are drawing up a draft Commission directive on this issue , which will apply to cotton seed seed .
strictly speaking , this issue falls within the remit of my colleague , Mr Liikanen .
Mr President , I thank the Commissioner for this information and the significant progress that has already been made on this issue .
the President of the Spanish Government - Mr Aznar - will visit this country formally in October this year .
I join the honourable Member and would like to express my admiration for Aung San Suu Kyi and her supporters of the National League for Democracy ( NLD ) .
the living conditions of the Burmese people are already bad enough because of the appalling government in which they suffer , and I do not wish to make any progress , which leads to a further deterioration .
I hope that we can continue to provide them with humanitarian aid , which is most important - and I would encourage them to return from Bangladesh and other countries in the region - to achieve a political solution , recognising the rights of these people but also the rights of those who were democratically elected ten years ago .
during my recent visit to Kosovo , I was very impressed by local people who reported to me that the electoral campaign was initiated in a very professional manner .
that concludes Question Time .
before a country has issued a licence that has rejected another , extensive multilateral consultations should take place .
the technology available to us and the expertise should be used for a sort of company @-@ creating type of society , for something that is of benefit to people , rather than for something that the people are destroying and dismantled .
the control mechanism must also be extended to include small arms and light weapons , which are widely applied in the world in numerous regional and ethnic conflicts , and are often used against civil servants and military personnel in the Member States of the Union .
Mr President , I am pleased that so many foreign travellers have found here today because , as everyone can see from there , only a few of them are present at this hour of night .
our committee largely supports the Commission &apos;s proposal but , in my report , I put forward a number of amendments which need to be implemented in order for the proposed separation of the areas of activity to work .
in recent years , Parliament was faced with the problem that too few standardised information about financial control came from the institutions .
the Commission is being challenged to convince Parliament that it can create such security .
the result is that the new man at the top will come from outside , but he is getting bogged down in the traps of an already firm apparatus .
in our opinion , the report contains a disagreement on the question , which my group does not agree either , namely whether the establishment of an internal auditor should be prescribed only for the Commission , the Council and the European Parliament , or even for the smaller institutions .
we promise very much of that .
Mr President , I wish to begin my speech by congratulating Mr van Hulten on this well @-@ drafted report , which earned the unanimous support of his colleagues in the Committee on Budgetary Control .
this very fact that , perhaps , there may be no longer any independence , it is up to us to take a separate view of this function .
I can therefore only reiterate that we have developed a very precise procedure to see whether the various Directorates @-@ General , which are supposed to be responsible for this ex ante control , are in a position to do this .
among other things , I would like to point out that Article 22 ( 2 ) of the directive expressly provides for appropriate measures to be taken by the Member States to ensure that television broadcasters do not contain programmes which make it difficult to affect the physical , mental and moral development of minors , in particular those which expose pornography or gratuitous violence .
we do not wish to replace anyone , of good things in nations , but we want to introduce common criteria and minimum standards at Community level , propose regulations that help people to really implement the tasks of the protection of minors .
it is not possible to deal with these issues by using technical means to control television broadcasting .
the President of the Commission , Mr Romano Prodi , said in his great speech yesterday that in future it will be necessary to define the political legitimacy of the EU in a catalogue with which areas the EU should deal with and which areas are a matter for the Member States .
Mr President , Commissioner , the way in which we are dealing with and access to television , that is to say new media is something quite everyday and self @-@ evident for our children .
Mr President , Commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , on a Sunday evening two weeks ago , in southern France , the 17 @-@ year @-@ old Robert and the 16 @-@ year @-@ old Robert murdered their sandwich and Roma , with a firearm and a back gun , for no reason without motivation , such as television .
children can cope with these filter devices very quickly than we do .
the Commission takes note of this request because , as you know , we need to review the Television Without Frontiers Directive in 2002 , in order to see how it has proved its worth .
we must ensure that the experience of young people - students and others in training - is positive .
I therefore hope that a definitive solution will finally be found in order to avoid the European Union ’ s mobility of students , young volunteers , teachers and trainers in the Community as a visible attribute of the European Union and , hence , the absurd situation that the transport of goods , capital and services is easier than the mobility of European citizens .
unfortunately , this will prevent young people from collecting studies , work and other experiences in another Member State .
I hope that the important amendments to which the Committee on Culture , Youth , Education , the Media and Sport have accepted a positive response from the Council and that legislation can be implemented quickly .
although freedom of movement and the free movement of goods , services and capital are enshrined in our Treaties , young people who are the future of the European Union and certainly have less prejudice than some representatives of our generation are denied opportunities at the expense of bureaucratic obstacles .
but the university , which does not respect its duties , should be scrapped .
that is precisely why I am still very surprised at how many obstacles there are of increased mobility and flexibility in Europe .
so , despite the problems I am well aware of and that continue to exist , these programmes have a positive effect and make a difference to our citizens .
thank you very much , Commissioner Reding .
on 6 July in Leipzig , you called for a future vision for Europe based on a draft Constitution .
I would like to pay tribute to the President of the Commission who , in this House yesterday , insisted on the role , collegiality and leadership of the Commission .
finally , we must open up the prospect of membership of the Union &apos;s institutional structure to the countries and the peoples of South @-@ East Europe .
what I am talking about here today is the balanced participation of women and men in all walks of life .
the Beijing Action Platform and the latest recommendations of the Beijing + 5 Special Session of the UN General Assembly are along the same lines : this is clear from the report prepared by the Finnish Presidency on women and decision @-@ making processes .
two examples : the Council &apos; Education &apos; , in conjunction with the mobility of students and teachers , because we have identified mobility of strong inequalities , and the Internal Market , consumption and tourism , in conjunction with the item on the development of electronic commerce , in order to make them available to all men and women , because , as we know , there is inequality between women and men .
Article 1 reiterates the general principle of equal rights for all human beings .
I should therefore like to call on the present and forthcoming Presidents @-@ in @-@ Office of the Council and the Commission to take this aspect into account , as I think it is extremely important for our work to make very great efforts in this area .
if you look at the policy on equality today , I have the impression that all of us here are sitting - and the majority of whom are women who are involved in the debate - of course we all really do do our best but are aware that the European equality policy is in danger of losing its momentum .
there are only a few examples : women are twice burdened with work and budget , unemployment is higher among women ; the conditions for child care have deteriorated , there are too few women in decision @-@ making posts , violence against women is growing in some candidate countries and several peripheral countries are centres of increasing trafficking in women .
Mrs Péry talked about how important it is to reconcile work and family life .
we must ensure that our decisions in Strasbourg represent real progress .
instead of raising everyone , we divide the minority into a minority , the minority community .
therefore , for example , other Members of this Parliament had to go to the pen to change the pen , something for which they thanked Poland .
educating children , in particular the sharing of standards and values , is vital to our society .
the first is to improve the existing directives , for example on equal treatment in the area of social security in public and operational systems .
I was in New York in Beijing and co @-@ rapporteur .
I would like to support the Committee on Women &apos;s Rights &apos;s request in this report for a full study of the situation of women in the European Union and the candidate countries as a starting point for future work .
furthermore , we believe that the quality and quantitative participation of women in the different Member States and , if possible , in the regions of Europe , is essential to ensure their participation in Commission action and programmes , as we believe there is a considerable lack of information between individuals and organised women &apos;s groups , but also an imbalance in their participation in the different regions of Europe .
this is therefore an extremely important question that we need to get to grips with .
Mr President , I should like to thank Mrs Pery and Commissioner Diamantopoulou for taking part in this plenary sitting .
Mr President , I shall not answer everyone individually , apart from Mrs Torres Marques , because she really has a very direct and personal question .
fourthly : the forward @-@ looking issues .
secondly , it allows a comparative assessment of both the Member States and a comparison of the overall development of the European Union during the relevant period .
I would like to thank Mrs Dybkjær once again because I believe she has produced an excellent , well @-@ researched text , which will be very helpful for our next report and , in particular , the French Presidency and Mrs Péry , who have energetically promoted the issue of equality during the presidency .
three of them - Nos 4 , 5 and 7 - relate to the comitology procedure .
the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market accepted this approach - the rapporteur - and therefore withdrew the amendments .
I must therefore admit that this amendment , like the Council and the Commission , is not justified in this case , and would like to repeat that the procedures of import controls in the European Union are not working , that fraud is committed and these cases of fraud are bad for the functioning of the internal market and even for fairness towards third countries .
this paves the way for an important reform of the economic customs systems , on which Parliament will , by the way , be informed of its adoption in the coming months .
yesterday , the Commission &apos;s position on the legal basis changed the whole position .
Mr President , we are delighted to welcome you to the European Parliament and wish you a happy visit .
( Parliament adopted the resolution )
European civil rights do not appear to weigh particularly hard here .
it is not just a symbol but it is a motivating factor , a boost to the culture and the European social model which we are asked to call for .
Mr President , I voted for the Cashman report because the pensioners &apos; federation , in which I live , and I myself , in the province of Bergamo , Italy - said to me : &apos; we have no means to defend the interests of the elderly .
apart from their different positions , they have shown that they will give their approval to an amendment that is justified , irrespective of who tabled it .
the provision that the concept of an essential occupational requirement can justify the exceptions justified may well be interpreted very widely .
at the same time , the amendment extending the principle of non @-@ discrimination , insofar as it involves discrimination on grounds of belief and no other reason , extends to the broader &apos; social &apos; activities of religious organisations , the specific nature and the independent contribution of these organisations to public or private institutions .
we have to ask ourselves whether common sense has always prevailed in the case of a number of very well @-@ meaning amendments which we now have .
the EPLP voted in favour of the Mann report on equal treatment and discrimination , because it is committed to the principle of combating unjustified discrimination and fully supports the overall objectives of this proposal .
we also consider it questionable to involve health , social security and social support , since there are considerable national differences in the handling of these sectors , as well as the question of whether they belong to the relations between employers and employers .
thanks to the actions of a rogue and the Committee of Wise Men , corruption was denounced .
we in Europe must , together with our colleagues throughout the world , ensure that the mistakes of the past are made up of our past .
the control of arms exports has , above all , been seen as a tool to avoid unpleasant situations for Europe &apos;s military industry , not as a way of creating peace and disarmament .
- ( SV ) It is good that the European Union wants to introduce a code of conduct on restrictive export of arms .
Angelilli report ( A5 @-@ 0258 / 2000 )
I would remind you that , according to the provisions of article Special ( 2 ) of the Television Without Frontiers Directive ( Directive 97 / 36 / EC of 30 June 1997 on the amendment of Directive 89 / 52 / EC ) , the Commission should carry out an investigation into the possible advantages and disadvantages of measures to facilitate the control of the programmes to be monitored by parents or other supervisors .
any further examination of specific technology , such as filtering systems , must take account of today &apos;s evident technological advances .
if the industry is encouraged to cooperate at international level and move in this direction , if parents , teachers and young people become more sensitive , positive results are to be expected .
finally , I would like to call on the Member States to pursue the dual approach advocated at Community level , namely mainstreaming and specific actions for the benefit of women .
the next item is the debate on topical and urgent subjects of major importance .
I therefore believe that the European institutions and the European Parliament , if they would help the Peruvian people at this difficult time , will contribute to the stability of the country and the consolidation of the democratic institutions throughout Latin America .
Mr President , Commissioner , the events in Peru reveal to us the difference that exists at times between the formal meaning of a word and its substantial weight .
in order to prevent it from becoming a reality , Europe must , as a matter of principle , engage in policy on the American subcontinent .
B5 @-@ 07@@ 89 / 2000 by Mrs Schroedter and others , on behalf of the Group of the Greens / European Free Alliance , on the situation in Afghanistan ;
it seems to be the case that groups of men live in a world where only their own cohesion and their own oppression of women play a role .
in other words , the conflict is much more complicated , it does not seem to be a solution , and yet , as we are in agreement , it is a matter of urgency .
that is why only a political solution can provide for the restoration of peace , stability and respect for rights .
other colleagues have talked about one million displaced people , from one million mutilated , from thousands of women who are deprived of their basic rights , such as the right to education , to work or to free movement ; for many of these women , it has to be terrible - since they were used to education and a secular life - to see that there is no freedom at all .
as long as the Taliban take such an ambiguous view of the control of opium poppy cultivation , the Commission will not promote any projects in the fight against drugs in Afghanistan .
however , as Mr Linkohr said just now , the problem with Latin America is that we are only dealing with these countries when there are difficulties .
since then , the situation has deteriorated for the local community .
B5 @-@ 07@@ 79 / 2000 by Mr Dupuis and others , on behalf of the Technical Group of Independent Members - mixed group , on Macedonia ;
unfortunately , it was , of course , the case that , in the last period up to 1998 , this problem was not resolved under the previous government .
that is a gain for Macedonia .
Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , my group will support the motion before us , which we have signed , because I believe it is right that a solution found in Macedonia that satisfies the Albanian population is also supported by the European Union .
that is why the Commission has repeatedly called on the Macedonia authorities to resolve the still outstanding issue of higher education in Albanian @-@ language language .
B5 @-@ 07@@ 91 / 2000 by Mr Korakas and others , on behalf of the Confederal Group of the European United Left / Nordic Green Left , on the sinking of the ferry &apos; Nations Express &apos; .
out of respect for Parliament &apos;s pre @-@ decision , we have tabled compromises and have prepared a common text , which is to be welcomed , admittedly , by all the political groups .
there are a number of amendments to the motion for a resolution itself , but I believe that the amendment on ship registers is already covered by the text , something that has already been mentioned .
in the brave world of invitations to tender , companies can too often be relegated to cost @-@ cutting measures , and I am reluctant to see this at the expense of security measures .
this is all the more tragic because the exemption from European Union legislation is due to it .
the Commission has the task of monitoring the practical application of this legal framework within the framework of the role laid down by the Treaty .
I would like to say that there is a very strange gap .
I do not deny you the fact that the situation is not easy and we will have to face certain tensions in the coming days , but all blood should remain in blood so that the situation does not escalate to a serious conflict .
victory was won , even though the regime has made a great effort and continues to do so in order to prevent it .
we strongly condemn the disproportionate and indiscriminate use of force .
today , the Parliament of Belgrade is in flames - we know what it means in the history of Europe , which is putting a fire to a parliament , and we are also aware of the responsibility of the leaders who are leading their peoples to disaster .
I was shocked by the majority that in the wake of the riots a car @-@ drivers were shot down down and a further health car , as I have seen myself , was shot down from 10 centimetres to shot because he wanted people to come .
&quot; but the right of the Palestinian State is not worth less .
as the events of recent days show , the peace process is particularly unstable .
such a situation requires sensitivity .
once again , on the one hand , it is a democratic state which carries out a difficult struggle in an extremely difficult situation and , on the other , it is the institution in the heart of Palestine , which , I admit , is being used on the first occasion with regard to firearms in order to shoot the forces of Israel and the forces of Israel .
the Commission and the Council will be doing your job , and that is the most important thing currently on the agenda in Yugoslavia ; that has always been our interest .
I would also like to make an appeal to the Council , but let me tell the Commission and ourselves that we must not just talk about the support we are giving to Serbia in the short term , but also in our own budget , the European Union &apos;s budget , so that we will not have to come to the conclusion that we will only be able to help Serbia if we cut back on other projects in the Balkans .
that is a report of 5.@@ 52 votes .
in particular , as regards the Committee of Inquiry , I would like to stress that this committee must be international , and that the responsibilities of this committee must be clearly defined .
in the current circumstances , the complete changeover to the euro would be a disaster .
Parliament has to decide on a very simple matter today , namely the inclusion of Croatia in the group of countries which the European Investment Bank can grant loan to which the EU guarantees .
in the 2001 budgetary procedure , our group supported a strategy aimed at providing a clear improvement in the quality of spending and the completion of implementation control mechanisms .
I would like to see the signs of hope in Croatia and now in Yugoslavia encourage us to find a solution to the problems of the budget and the financial perspectives .
the European Union cannot allow itself to be caught by empty @-@ handed in the words of yesterday and after the guarantee that this guarantee will be shared in Belgrade this morning .
Croatia started with democratisation and democracy ten years ago .
that is why it is important for Croatia finally to be given an association agreement that makes it clear that this is a European country with a clear prospect of accession to the European Union .
it is good , therefore , that a regulation is now being found for it .
in the feasibility report on a stabilisation and association agreement with Croatia from May 2000 , the Commission concluded that the conditions for the opening of negotiations with Croatia have been met .
after many years of difficulties for these people - difficulties of any kind - an extremely democratic path will finally be taken to allow Serbia back into the international community of the European Union .
are there any other comments on the Minutes ?
Parliament should raise these violations and , of course , call for a repeat of the elections in the province .
Madam President , there are new victims of ETA , but there are also new victims of the Spanish oppression : new arrests , new cases of torture , further depopulation in the Basque Country .
I do not think that applying the rule of one @-@ minute rule is the worst solution , as we have seen in the case .
as far as Mr Le Pen is concerned , it is unreasonable to the European Parliament and to every democrat if Mr Le Pen speaks of &apos; dignity &apos; .
nevertheless , we would like to repeat this once again for political reasons .
we are not doing anything else than what we have already done in the area of forestry and plants , namely that we are adopting this reference to the horizontal directive .
I am quoting the letter of 17 May , literally , that you yourself , Madam President , have read out in plenary .
I personally felt unable to criticise this because it was my party friends who have always been exposed to political arguments for political reasons , so my criticism would seem to serve purely party political interests .
we must be able to see where progress is made , they need to be visible , and the social policy agenda must be at the heart of the political debate at the summit of the European Council .
I am convinced that Europe will only be social if the social component is also taken into account in economic policy , in competition policy , in foreign policy and in the whole debate on enlargement .
I should like first of all to thank Mrs Van Lancker and the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs and its chairman for the report we are discussing today and which demonstrates the European Parliament &apos;s motivated and remarkable commitment to the social policy agenda .
above all , we are concerned with the objective of full employment .
I should like to say a few words about the mobility of workers .
we have also managed to achieve some improvements in the social sphere , but not everything that was connected with the fact that the Treaty of Amsterdam has not been in force yet , in this regard , this social action programme , or this social agenda , is of particular importance .
in its communication , the Commission set a framework for the social policy agenda , which I believe to be an excellent spirit of the Lisbon Summit .
the social and maintaining the European social model calls for initiatives to create the right to income , pay and the right to decent pensions for all citizens of the European Union .
however , I believe that the driving force must come from the bottom up , and aid should be set at the level of the problems .
the priority was to build the common market : the free movement of goods and capital , the creation of rules on competition between companies and state aid .
the report makes this rather different : while reforming the social model in Lisbon calls for the report to be consolidated , calling for more entrepreneurship and flexibility in Lisbon , the report proposes new or amended directives and a series of legislative initiatives .
Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , I would like to congratulate two of them in particular , firstly to Mrs Van Lancker for her excellent report , to the Commissioner , Mrs Diamantopoulou , on her excellent presentation .
I also think it would be very beneficial if we could implement the amended and updated directive on maternity leave , i.e. women will be supported in pregnancy and , if they continue to work during this period , they will be subject to maternity protection .
social quality should not be in vain .
these two policy concepts are along the lines of the whole agenda .
the difficulty is that the Social Policy Agenda , on the basis of its legal basis , is not a legislative proposal and does not constitute a directive , which requires concrete steps to be taken by the Member States .
in spite of initial difficulties , this work has been completed fairly quickly .
I mention this only , in order to avoid confusing the technical procedures .
problems of access to social security must be individualised in this respect .
it addresses all the areas in which action needs to be taken , and as long as successful coordination is concerned , this should have a significant impact on all aspects of women &apos;s daily lives .
in this area , as in many others , it is urgently necessary for the public authorities to show real pluralism in the selection of their interlocutors .
it is also about equal access and full use of social rights for men and women , which requires the monitoring of social legislation in respect of maternity leave , maternity leave , working hours , employment contracts , etc .
this is consistent implementation of the gender mainstreaming approach .
Mr President , I would be extremely sorry if Minister Nicole Pery did not take the opportunity to present her views as well , now that she is here .
the vote will take place tomorrow at 12.30 p.m.
that is quite simply not right .
the internal market plays an important role in promoting consumer interests .
I will mention one of the many examples of this , an example which is not just the subject of intense discussion in my region .
200 years have elapsed since then , and it is true that a great deal of work has happened , of course , but we are still striving for the same goals .
of course , individual treasuries or Ministers of Finance who travel around in Europe listen to statements of this kind .
finally , let me say this : we need a more precise definition of the relevant market , because the market is often not the national market .
in the future , we must remember that , for example , there is national aid to competition in the Member States , which is very important and very important for countries with sparse population and long distances .
in this context , you have revised a communication on services of general interest and presented the legal situation again .
I would like to thank Mrs Riis @-@ Jørgensen for her valuable contribution as rapporteur for the Commission report on competition policy .
particular attention was paid to the concerns that Parliament expressed in relation to the issues of renationalisation and legal certainty .
instead , we must work together for the gradual development of a single market that goes beyond the national market .
I have only spoken on behalf of my group , not for Parliament as a whole .
the aim of this report by the Commission is to provide a basis for examining and amending the single system of medium @-@ term financial assistance .
the next item is the report ( A5 @-@ 0195 / 2000 ) by Mrs Klaß on behalf of the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development .
in plain language , this means that Parliament is indirectly giving the green light to experiments involving GMOs in increasing and improving vineyards .
it is to be expected that the new and updated provisions of the proposed directive will meet the expectations of vineyards and those of wine @-@ growing , improve the products offered , as well as facilitating the control of transport with precious grain and plant good by the institutions involved .
while at the same time the Commission appears to be tackling the fever of cloning and GMOs , the rapporteur has had the passion of adding all possible elements of GMOs to the concept of GMOs .
finally , we can take over Amendment No 27 later by Mr Lavarra and Mr Garot , and I am very pleased to be able to tell you that we also have the amendments tabled by Mr Graefe zu Baringdorf tabled
Madam President , I would like to say that in paragraph 13 of the Minutes , you agreed to speak on behalf of Parliament , as the chairman of the Committee on Legal Affairs thought , to speak on behalf of the committee , on behalf of Parliament .
they can review this in the verbatim report of proceedings .
as far as the Intergovernmental Conference is concerned , the work before Biarritz at ministerial level was already proceeding as far as possible , and the informal Council was therefore held at the right moment to confirm certain progress in order to provide guidelines for the final stage we are now in .
the two concepts are therefore still on the negotiating table and must be judged according to their ability to maintain the general interest of the Community .
in accordance with its commitments , the European Union removed the consequences of this political change at the meeting of the General Affairs Council of 9 October and decided to suspend the sanctions , including the oil and aviation embargo imposed on the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia in 1998 , excluding Milosevic himself and its immediate followers .
a solution must be found for these two issues , which will be decided not only at the end and where there will be no agreement on the details , if there is no overall agreement .
that was a positive signal .
the President @-@ in @-@ Office spoke of the spirit of Nice .
it is an important matter both for us and for those who , if necessary , join us .
Madam President , first of all I would like to congratulate the European Council for having adopted the draft Charter as binding .
that is why I am expressing the wish of my group and many NGOs to further develop the Charter , to further improve , in particular to secure better protection and more effective rights for European citizens , the workers , the citizens of third countries and the excluded .
this is the only way to restore a real balance between the different institutions of our European Union .
it would indeed have been possible to expect a little better weather , but , in my opinion , the weather at the European Council , to which I was involved from the beginning to the end , was a little better than the Commissioner indicated .
in any case , it is a question of strengthening the Community framework .
this is the first text of the European Union to be read by the citizens , without being completely alien to its content .
at any rate , in my opinion Biarritz has made something very positive : the unanimous adoption of the Charter .
that is why so much is spoken of by large and small .
in my opinion , this is not realistic .
we therefore agreed on minimum standards ; we have a minimum charter , particularly as regards social rights .
we all know that the enlargement of the Union will only be possible after a reform of the decision @-@ making structures within the key institutions , but a reform process of this kind must be fair and balanced .
our debate today is also marked by this .
as regards Article 7 , which deals with action in the event of a violation of the fundamental values of the European Union , things are moving in motion .
another aspect concerns the reform of the Commission .
fulfilling the demands of the large countries , after more power in the Council and in Parliament , would upset the balance within the European Union and would mean that the small countries will pay the entire price for enlargement .
the tragic developments in the Middle East have , of course , caused enormous setbacks , and the violence of the last few days , the many victims of which have , of course , also moved to the European public and to us in this House , and rightly so .
Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , I am sorry that Mr Barón Crespo is not in the Chamber after he made certain statements about the political force I have taken .
but we should also look at our own situation .
we have to recognise that the small states are equal to the countries of the Union with the large states , and that we have to reconcile the balance for the large states in another way .
the text , as I have heard , was welcomed in Biarritz and can be adopted following consultation of the Court of Justice , with an official proclamation at the Nice Summit and will be incorporated into the Treaties in future .
the question is whether all the countries should have a Commissioner at the same time and that , therefore , we should have one large Commission , one day , which would inevitably have to be reformed , or whether it should not at the same time be the case at the same time .
I have just mentioned very clearly some of the elements on the basis of which we can gauge immediately whether the reform is sufficient or insufficient .
oral question to the Commission , pursuant to Rule 42 of the Rules of Procedure by Mr Napolitano , on behalf of the Committee on Constitutional Affairs , on the status of islands , on behalf of the Committee on Constitutional Affairs .
when peace was secured , Western Europe worked for more prosperity .
we want a true Constitution .
finally , enhanced cooperation , which is open and non @-@ negotiable , involving those Members who , either now or later , want to include , involve and do not rule out , give impetus and influence and do not set up new barriers .
we are not asking for anything concrete or special , we are not asking for assistance : we are asking for this principle of island status to be recognised by everyone so that all citizens of the Union can get off on an equal footing with equal opportunities .
I do not think you can say that all 15 would fall as if I want to highlight such a self @-@ evident picture .
I think that only then can we really talk about a constitution and look at the way in which it is drawn up , when we know what to do with it .
some of you , including some of the Member States , have already said that the traditional method of the Intergovernmental Conference is certainly not the best .
as regards your proposal to discuss this issue at the Intergovernmental Conference , it seems to me quite clear that , given the volume and difficulty of the other on the agenda of the IGC , it would be more appropriate , as was the case with other material errors in articles of the Treaties , to correct the way in which the procedures laid down in the Vienna Convention on the law of the treaties are corrected in order to bring the individual language versions into line .
we no longer have any conditions on that .
furthermore , it must not constitute an obstacle to trade , nor should it lead to the fragmentation of the internal market , an obstacle to the solidarity and cohesion of the Member States or , as Commissioner Barnier said , to the watering down of the acquis communautaire .
following the hopefully successful Nice Summit , we must take another step in the direction of greater democratisation of the Union .
I will do all I can to persuade my countrymen to carry the baton on during the Swedish Presidency .
indeed , it cannot be a case of only the Fifteen debating a constitution and deciding where we all know that , by the end of this decade , we will have a Europe of 27 .
however , what is being done together is bound to happen at the same time !
I am still listening to the arguments against and warning of a multi @-@ speed Europe .
firstly , it concerns method ; it is a void and opaque procedure for the public which , in reality , excludes the other institutions of the Union and where the governments fall victim to their own labyrinth .
Mr President , as we have heard , progress has been made in Biarritz in terms of increased cooperation .
on the other hand , there is a risk that enhanced cooperation will call into question the unity of Europe from a different direction and gives us a mosaic of different types of intergovernmental cooperation .
however , I admit that the political conditions for this would not be there , and I therefore fully agree with the Duhamel report now under discussion .
Mr President , as the last speaker I would like to congratulate Mr Duhamel on his excellent work as well as Mr Gil @-@ Robles .
that is why we want this matter to be referred back to us .
I do not take note of that .
what does the phrase &apos; in which the individual unemployed have access to active employment policies &apos; is to guarantee more than 2 years of less than 2 years &apos; because they are more than a threat to the unemployment rate ?
Mr President , I voted for the Souchet report , which aims to increase the volume of pre @-@ packaged agricultural products .
I would ask why I did so , because it confirms the fact that normal stocks of genetically modified varieties may be developed and that we will possibly be able to drink GM wine in the future .
it is being proposed to authorise the marketing of vineyards of sound low standards to temporary difficulties , but without specifying the extent to which it might be taking action .
the reason is that Mr Smith has paid a low pension contribution , while Mr Chirac pays a very high proportion of his pay for that .
in principle , the decentralised application of Community law will only be successful if everything is to be applied uniformly to all regions of the European Union .
- State aid has traditionally been used by Member States as instruments of economic and social policy .
I am less satisfied with the recital in point 2 , which states that State aid should not be raised .
we find the constant pressure and institutional measures proposed in relation to a register and an evaluation of state aid under the &apos; yield &apos; to be unacceptable .
section V - Court of Auditors
even the Commission has been very reluctant in its approach to payments in the preliminary draft budget , with cautious restraint as we find ourselves .
this must be counter @-@ controlled at every political level , local , regional , national , and also European ones .
after the positive outcome of the elections in Serbia , however , we are also committed to providing support for Serbia , not just fine words in soapbox speeches .
thirdly , there must be an added value for taxpayers &apos; money .
we are directly linked to the European Central Bank &apos;s interest rate , which is why we are proposing that the policy taken in the buildings should continue , because this will help to rid ourselves of these interest rates as soon as possible .
a major concern is still the Economic and Social Committee .
Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , in June 2002 the ECSC Treaty expires .
this seems paradoxical to us , because there is still a operating budget in the second half of 2002 , and we therefore want to see a review of the relationship between adaptation aid and social aid .
the proposal that I ask you to support , by voting in favour of the report , is the culmination of a long process and takes account of Parliament &apos;s aspirations .
we believe that this declaration should be part of the interinstitutional agreement , but in any case , ladies and gentlemen , I would like to point out to you , ladies and gentlemen , that it only has meaning in an interinstitutional agreement with a financial perspective .
my wish is that the budgetary work will continue in the same spirit , so that we can come to a budget for 2001 , which will enable us to meet the priorities and challenges that will be facing the European Union in the near future .
with regard to the EUR 225 million of savings in rural development , the Council &apos;s position takes account of the delay in the national development plans for rural areas .
that , too , seems to me to be excessive too .
what we are asking for on the part of the Member States also applies to the European budget , and to reconcile all of this will make budgetary policy more exciting , as we all know .
among other things , it formulated the condition of changing the comitology procedure .
the question of whether the necessary measures can be removed from the previous approach to the Mediterranean programme is a political and not a technical question .
we must support the efforts of Mr Prodi and Mr Patten to strengthen the Commission &apos;s capacity to act through parliamentary scrutiny and the necessary parliamentary scrutiny , which does not refer to the Council and Mr Solana .
the first concerns the creation of a pilot project to fund an information campaign in all fifteen Member States to combat the criminal scourge of paedophilia .
here the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs asked for expert knowledge to be given by the European Central Bank on the subject of the money issue .
the proposals put forward by our committee , which the Committee on Budgets also support , are much better .
anyone who claims there is about resolving mergers or putting a stop to globalisation says this is simply polemics .
the House now has a duty to support these points this week in order to demonstrate its continued commitment to environmental protection and the improvement of public health .
the Committee on Fisheries , which is in accord with the Commission in the principle of budgetary discipline , has accepted the limits that it set in its preliminary draft , and expressed its concerns about certain budget lines .
everyone must assume their responsibilities and fulfil their commitment .
the European Commission was unable to discuss the enlargement priorities , and this led to unacceptable delays in the execution of the appropriations which , under the pressure , were constantly increasing budgets for assistance to assistance and cooperation abroad .
we also have to realise that this is all connected with the fight against domestic violence that has been included in the cofinancing programme .
no one is better able , as the guardian of the treaties , to be better than the citizens of Europe .
our debate today takes place against the background of using all possible means available to us in our budget to ensure that our European institutions are ready for the next stage of enlargement , both in terms of institutional structures and improved policy management .
before I turn to this question I should like to say something briefly about the position of the British Conservatives .
we understand that there is a need for further staff , but most of us believe that we will only be able to fulfil this idea if the process of institutional reform has made visible progress .
one thing , however , is that , of course , in places where the taxpayer is listening to us , it gives the taxpayer carte blanche to get a real picture of the conditions under which we work .
in the past , however , we have promises , or announcements made , that we have jointly formulated policies which , at some point , have to be implemented in the form of payments .
I would like to make it quite clear that I think it is criminal , people who are affected by disasters , to give the impression that we can solve all the problems they are having to deal with them .
even though we share the criticism of the Council on many points , it remains to be said that it would not be a form of confrontation politically speaking politically and would undermine the credibility of the European institutions .
we are afraid of the majority in the committee .
yesterday evening , our general @-@ general rapporteur , Mrs Haug , tried to amend her report on this issue in order to respond to the concerns expressed by my group , for which I should like to thank her .
it is possible to make significant savings , either because of the lack of implementation of certain programmes , or whether the European Union finally finds itself hard to resort to federalist propaganda .
we must give the Commission the opportunity to reduce the backlog of staffing .
the tax burden must therefore be lowered on a percentage point , and increased government revenue can only be achieved through an economic recovery and the associated economic growth .
these are obvious requirements , the commitments are numerous and the contribution of external cooperation to the European Union is clear and the implementation of various programmes is very inadequate .
we are trying to defend Parliament &apos;s priorities in category 4 .
we have evidence that is different to what they are estimated are to be scientifically justified .
( laughter and applause )
for example , it is not the case that the &apos; small countries &apos; - a totally inappropriate name - should not be afraid of exclusion from increased cooperation , or that increased cooperation has something to do with an avant @-@ vanguard or a focal point and a coherent character .
that is why I think it is entirely appropriate to entrust this task with an external and moral authority in this case .
the authorities must determine the ways and means of resolving the paramilitaries by the Colombian Government themselves are determined by the Colombian authorities themselves .
many of us believe that the problems in Colombia , as well as in other Latin American countries , are the question of whether the farmers are or are not .
I believe I have already answered this question .
I do not want the impression that the impression is made that the Council is not answering the questions put to it .
can the Presidency , after its all @-@ out consultations with the economic and finance ministers of the countries of the European Union and of third countries , indicate where the resistance originates and which , in its opinion , are the main political or technical barriers to the introduction of a Tobin tax ?
the introduction of a Tobin tax is somewhat more appealing , as many advocates of the left @-@ wing and right @-@ wing , political and non @-@ political organisations , NGOs and higher education groups .
Mr President , I do not doubt your personal convictions .
I am sorry about that .
that is why they sometimes do not differentiate between comrades and the President @-@ in @-@ Office of the Council .
the real question that I am trying to ask myself just as a politically committed one is , according to the conditions that need to be given in order for the matter to work .
the Council is working actively on examining the Commission proposal and the proposed amendments in order to reach an opinion on this issue as soon as possible .
- ( FR ) The honourable Member will certainly not be surprised if I did not refer in detail to a debate on BSE , following the debate on the Tobin tax .
thank you for your answer , Mr President , but my question went further .
Mr President , Commissioner , I should first of all like to congratulate the rapporteur .
at the time we did not know that the Council and the Commission had promised this aid for reconstruction in Serbia and in Kosovo .
in Europe , too , there are the arms , and we only have to think of farmers in retirement .
the external requirements are self @-@ evident the scarcity of category 4 .
we are now in the first reading and you have plenty of time to find the full agreement with Parliament .
we can only work in a transparent way and respond to our accountability when all the decision @-@ makers know the budget and also with the background .
as an elected representative , I am , of course , delighted with every improvement that makes the budget clearer .
on the contrary , it requires us to find a solution to the support of Serbia .
I am very pleased at the opportunity to contribute to this important debate , and I would like to stress the importance of the agricultural budget and its impact , not only for farmers but also for society in general .
Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , Commissioner , first of all , I should like , of course , to thank all the rapporteurs , who , I am convinced , have worked hard .
Mr President , the Council has actually surpassed itself with the draft budget that it presented for 2001 .
political stability is dependent on the improvement of living conditions .
in this respect , and given the Commission &apos;s admission that Member States &apos; requests for payments to the structural funds for 2001 exceed EUR 8 billion , I think it is now time for the Council to reflect very seriously on the need for us to do something about payments rather than to increase the RAL .
before this point is properly resolved and discussed , I refuse to talk about any revision of the Financial Perspective .
after all , the Ministers for Finance got a lot more back from the budget of the previous year .
Sweden would have to pay for around EUR 65 million .
our group is focusing on the general budget on the quality of the expenditure and the efficiency of management , including the ECSC budget .
but my question concerns the ACP .
in fact , these subsidies must gradually be phased out , provided , however , that the farmers affected are given structural aid for conversion .
without wishing to justify myself , I would like to mention the impact that the European Union has had in my region .
according to the European model , the protection of personal data is considered a fundamental right , which will be guaranteed by rules governing the law and must be based on the principle of self @-@ determination on information , so that everyone can decide for themselves whether and how the data in question can be collected and used .
I trust that the carefully prepared report will find the full approval of the European Parliament and the Council .
I really hope that this will ensure that the provisions are not implemented in this way .
in my opinion , we would be burying our heads in the sand if this authority were only created for the Community area , while the main problems are currently facing the institutions of the third pillar , and will continue to do so in the future .
I believe that the rapporteur has done the best to expand , in future , to broaden the opportunities for cooperation and perhaps also to influence this area , which is why we fully support her report .
the Commission takes the following opinion on the amendments contained in the Paciotti report .
the European Data Protection Supervisor will play a fundamental role in the Community institutions &apos; compliance with data protection legislation .
the Azores , the Canaries , Guadeloupe , gulags , Madeira , Martinique and Réunion place special areas , whose unique situation in the Amsterdam Treaty has been recognised by the innovative concept of ultra @-@ peripheral regions .
the success of the new Community strategy for the outermost regions requires a focus on the strategic areas of global competition : transport , energy , the environment , the information society , research and technological development .
we hope that the Commission will implement this timetable or the programme and , above all , we hope that this large institution , through which the Commission now has the inter @-@ services group , will maintain contact with the outermost regions and inform the central authorities about our concerns and our specific problems .
what we are talking about here today and voting on tomorrow will appear practically on the front pages of the headlines of the seven outermost regions , and the news of the regional television channels will give a detailed account of what is being discussed and decided on here .
that is why it is so difficult for us to create wealth and employment .
I therefore welcome the fact that the Committee on Regional Policy has made a bold and ambitious contribution to state aid , to taxation , to the consequences of enlargement .
owing to the constant unfavourable factors , the special status and the exceptional assistance for remote areas are justified , but the differences should not be offset by permanent restrictions on internal market rules or permanent privileges for structural funds .
Mr President , the adoption of measures and specific programmes for the outermost regions has been driven forward mainly by this Parliament - and , in particular , its Committee on Regional Policy - .
that is why it is necessary for them to be treated in a specific manner and for the sake of consistency in a number of measures .
therefore , in the context of the preparation of the previous Intergovernmental Conference , you fully supported the negotiations which - I remember very well since I was at the time of the French representatives during the negotiations on the Treaty of Amsterdam - led to the adoption of Article 299 ( 2 ) .
in the fullness of time , such support and signalling will be needed even vis @-@ à @-@ vis the Council .
Mr Pohjamo , you raised those concerns just now , Mr Pohjamo , when you mentioned the work and commitment of Mr Sanchez @-@ write , whom I would ask you to pass on to our wishes for a speedy recovery in the face of its current health problems .
on 23 November 1999 , there was a partnership day that many of us attended .
I do not wish to raise this issue again .
Mr President , Mr Evans has just raised the subject of last morning &apos;s votes and , in particular , the vote on which some amendments were adopted by a majority of only one vote .
we are what we eat - in my case , unfortunately , this is actually the case .
this was the case with the company in the United Kingdom , which made a vaccine against children from the foetal bovine animals banned since 1999 , and the one thousand kilos of BSE contaminated by BSE @-@ contaminated beef in a French food distribution chain .
the decision @-@ making process should be comprehensible and transparent .
Mr President , first of all I would like to warmly congratulate the rapporteur , Mr Bowis , and to say to Commissioner David Byrne that we appreciate the work that he has proposed in this White Paper and his relationship with Parliament on the basis of which it would like to draw up legislation that is the best possible solution in the area of food safety .
this will not be a day of celebration for us , because it has been possible to find out that the procedures followed then were inadequate .
these areas are inextricably linked to the future tasks of the Food Safety Authority .
the report is right to make risk assessment , on the one hand , and risk management separately from one another .
allow me , however , to highlight one or two points in particular .
after all , who would point citizens better than the Member States to the dangers associated with this or that product ?
the WHO programmes are not limited to Europe ; they have a much greater scope and cover all the countries on earth .
this makes sense for the European Food Authority to be able to act independently of the Commission and , if necessary , to take crisis management as quickly as possible .
I have tabled an amendment on this subject , and I would ask you to support it .
this is not so much a matter of us and the Commission , because the Member States are asking for it , because they have not done their homework .
my group supports most of the amendments .
a clear legal framework , the identification of the tolerable risk and the specific protection of local food and production diversity are aspects that still need more consideration as regards the consideration of small and medium @-@ sized enterprises and the training of their employees .
with a European food authority , would there have been a dioxin crisis and an BSE crisis to be prevented ?
there is an inseparable link between healthy eating and good eating , an element that needs to be made even more aware to consumers by increasing quality and promoting typical local produce , which is a very valuable asset of the people of Europe .
that is why we will adopt and support the report , as my colleague Mr Papayannakis has said .
furthermore , no food containing genetically modified or genetically modified ingredients may arrive in the food chain before being fully tested and with clear labelling .
Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , the White Paper on food safety has created an important basis for a better diet in the future and , I hope , more environmentally friendly food production .
in order to regain and maintain the confidence of consumers in food safety , the Food Safety Authority , with its activities , must receive sufficient public funds .
Mr President , I congratulate John Bowis for his good work .
personally , I do not think so , but I trust in the strength and the fundamental principles of European unification throughout the EU .
furthermore , the efficiency of the authorities must be based on transparent decision @-@ making and rapid publication of their examinations and recommendations on the Internet , such as the European Food and Veterinary Office in Dublin , which is functioning excellently .
I welcome the broad consensus on the key principles , which are to establish a new scientific body tasked with assessing the safety risk of food that this body should be independent , accountable and transparent and subject to the requirements of objective research and normal confidentiality , while providing the public with easy accessible and understandable information .
the experiences and findings of the others can be combined here , and it is possible to evaluate the findings as a whole at European level .
we have scientific committees that advise the Commission .
even at the very important point of the White Paper , namely the creation of the Food Safety Authority , there were very conflicting opinions .
these principles are based on primary and absolute interest for the people .
after its thorough examination in the Member States and here in the European Parliament , the White Paper should also be legislative in the form of a new directive .
several proposals have already been submitted to the Council and to Parliament , such as the package of proposals on recasting and updating hygiene rules .
I am very pleased by the broad agreement between Parliament &apos;s position , as expressed in the report presented , and the White Paper itself .
Mr President , Commissioner , ladies and gentlemen .
a final point on the amendments .
in this context , we must unfortunately mention that a Member State - Finland - has not yet been signed , and has not yet been ratified by another Member State , Greece , as our fellow Member , Mrs Morgantini , has just said .
the challenge is huge , but the dimension of this tragedy has forced a great deal of effort and commitment to put an end to this situation .
finally , the European Parliament has taken a leading role within the Union in the fight against landmines .
as long ago as 1997 , the European Union clearly stated in its joint action that as many countries as possible should join the Ottawa Convention and ratify it .
we have argued for a flexible , coordinated approach , and we reject a rigid , centralised approach .
we do not want to set up any more committee , either as an administrative body or an advisory body .
governments have affirmed their willingness to support and have provided considerable financial resources .
the Commissioner responsible for external relations has recently admitted that the Commission does not deserve praise for the external assistance programmes .
Commissioner , you said that you rejected some of the amendments .
Mrs Bonino and Mr Patten are right to propose the destruction of the camp , because the destruction of a similar mine will cost just one hundredth of what we need to spend in order to destroy an appropriate and hard @-@ pressed mine .
all the EU institutions must play an active role and ensure that the poor countries most affected by the mines problem are included intensively in the programme .
their disposal is not a military problem , but rather a humanitarian one .
I should like to stress at this point that it is necessary to ask more states to accede to the Ottawa Convention or to ratify it quickly , in order to facilitate international coordination and rehabilitation of victims .
that is why I would ask that the Council , which is not present here , and the Commission , should inform the Commission of the importance of increasing this sum , given the fact that there are between 20 and 50 new ones .
however , we should also make it easier for the European Union , and the European Parliament in particular , to better review where our funding in this area actually goes .
many victims are young children , terrible impressions , terrible mutilations , who lost their lives before they have just begun .
I wish , in particular , to highlight the full implementation of the Treaty to make it a full success , firstly by bringing the laws in the individual states into line with them so that we do not have another example of an international agreement that is not being implemented .
however , the criticism also contains a degree of hypocrisy and ignorance .
the effectiveness of these efforts must also be increased by coordinating and controlling these processes and giving the NGOs a greater role .
the reports say less about the fact that most mines have not been manufactured in the countries in which they are laid down .
I can only shudder if the Commission really should go to fulfilling those who have just adopted absolutely unrealistic , almost insane demands .
the Commission will exercise its right of initiative and will support the Member States in implementing the necessary changes .
many of the demands contained in the Van Lancker report are unacceptable .
apart from all the legal niceties that have been put forward , the Biarritz summit confirmed that the European enlargement process is an arduous bargaining chip .
- we in the Freedom Party have come out from the outset in favour of a Charter of Fundamental Rights and its legal obligation .
the EPLP has consistently failed to support the inclusion of the Charter of Fundamental Rights , since these rights are covered by national legislation and the European Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms .
however , we believe that the interpretations of 15 judges who , once ratified , go beyond the treaties , are clearly unjustified , and we are still waiting for their submission by citizens in the Member States .
we should not accept this , regardless of the choice of words , from the extreme right or the extreme left .
the Portuguese socialist Members voted for the Duhamel report on the constitutionalisation of the Treaties , essentially because it reflects the need for the European Union to simplify and redesign the main texts on which it is based , because they are now almost beyond comprehension as a result of the complexity of the current collection of contracts .
the adoption of such a constitution is desirable in itself , but it should be the crowning glory of an in @-@ depth institutional reform .
Jacques Delors rightly recalled just one month ago , at a meeting of our Committee on Constitutional Affairs , on the fact that the term &apos; constitution &apos; is extremely unclear .
I would also vote against if that were not a very radical way to upgrade a text that is less important than this ...
British Labour members of the Group of the Party of European Socialists welcome this report , even though they cannot agree on all the details .
all of us here know that Europe , its diplomacy , its security , its culture and its culture , its culture and its social model will survive if it includes a federation of nation states that have strong , coherent and respected institutions on the basis of a European Constitution for which our colleague Mr Duhamel has opened a European Constitution .
waiving the requirement for closer cooperation within the framework of the Treaty , as well as the abolition of the right of veto and the possibility of presenting the subject to the European Council , would be an infringement of fundamental principles of European cooperation within the EU .
the fact is that although this report tries to make provision for a degree of more flexible design of the very rigid rules provided for in Title VII of the Treaty of Amsterdam , the final result is still very inadequate .
indeed , Europe is becoming increasingly difficult to move forward at the same speed .
that is why we are spending so large amounts within the framework of the EU Structural Funds .
if enhanced cooperation proves to be necessary , I believe that only the Community system will provide the necessary guarantees of democratic monitoring , judicial control and solidarity .
finally , we deplore the lack of reference or at least mention of the need to protect biodiversity , which is one of the greatest wealth of the outermost regions .
the Europe of Brussels , with its addiction to the levelling @-@ out and standardisation , is unfair or even stupid towards our fellow citizens , who are losing our values to thousands of kilometres of Paris , Madrid or Lisbon .
the Netherlands and Denmark , too , have two overseas capacities in the Atlantic Ocean and outside the Atlantic , but they are clearly not included in the European Union .
one of the most important points is the European Food Safety Authority , which we welcome and look forward to .
it was vital for us to express our opinion on a subject that is so important to our fellow citizens .
however , this does not correspond at all to the ideas in the White Paper , according to which the European authority &apos; will become the main scientific authority of the entire Union &apos; ( conclusions )
however , we must go further .
in France , for my part , I do not need an authority that can give me confidence ; I have confidence in AFSSA and its opinions , particularly on mad cow disease .
I respect , on the one hand , the democratic right of Members to table amendments but , on the other , I would just like to point out to the Members of this House that , if some of the amendments are voted on , which do not fall within the general framework agreement between the groups , we will soon have to break the upper limits and stop voting .
the same applies to line B3 @-@ 306 in relation to the Prince programme .
it is an amendment by the ELDR Group to increase tobacco subsidies by EUR 5 million , and I note that there are proposals for budgetary cuts here .
( DE ) Madam President , then we unfortunately have to vote for the Committee on Budgets &apos; amendment as we had in the Committee on Budgets .
( Parliament adopted the resolution )
report ( A5 @-@ 0270 / 2000 ) by Mr Moreira da Silva on behalf of the Committee on the Environment , Public Health and Consumer Policy : EU policies and measures to reduce greenhouse gas emissions :
instead of controlling the wild movements of capital , the priority is given to &apos; structural reforms &apos; , which in reality are designed to privatise and monitor everything that remains .
we believe that the Balkans should instead be transferred from the programmes to category 4 , which unfortunately are not being used fully today .
Haug report ( A5 @-@ 0300 / 2000 )
we would also like to congratulate Parliament on its open @-@ mindedness , which , in our view , has shown Parliament &apos;s attention to this initiative .
it is interesting to note that the EU parties obviously do not succeed in moving their Member States or their individual members to contributions to EU membership contributions , so that financing with public funds is required .
unbundled access to the local loop requires , in fact , to put public operators , as soon as possible , to provide commercial tenders for the leasing of public telephone telephone lines .
however , precisely because it is about the allocation of participants , the interests of the customer are particularly to be taken into account .
the quotas and the thresholds are similar to &apos; Scylla and Charybdis &apos; and their change is going from bad to worse .
in view of the fact that Annex III will not be a beneficiary of the proposed aid scheme for fruit and vegetables , my concerns have been cleared up for the time being .
&quot; I would therefore stress , even though I voted in favour of this report , in my explanation of vote that , next time , we should review and take account of the living conditions of the elderly in Hong Kong , compared with those of pensioners in the People &apos;s Republic of China in order to ascertain whether or not this reunification had a beneficial or detrimental effect on them .
only three years after the Kyoto conference , the European Environment Agency expects that emissions in the EU should develop in today &apos;s world not only on the 8 % reduction in CO2 emissions in the 1990 @-@ 2010 period , but with an increase of 6 % , while the forecasts in the United States are even worse .
the rapporteur is right in saying that the original proposal of the European Commission is inadequate .
that is why our resolution , for which I voted , is so important .
we all know that our entire lives are associated with risks and uncertainties .
it is also necessary to establish a more concrete framework for research , the standardisation of tests and the cooperation of various scientific teams in order to achieve credible results .
we need to take further steps .
to achieve this they need the support of the Member States .
this would give these companies the opportunity to settle themselves across the European Union , although they are not banks .
it is still in place until today , because the many cases put forward by small and medium @-@ sized enterprises are simply the order of the day .
spot checks are indeed sufficient .
the acceptance of the euro depends , for example , on whether customers and companies understand the euro zone as payment countries .
perhaps , no - what I am saying - and it will , of course , be time for an Internet bank that does not take charges .
there is a second reason for the insistence of the European Parliament .
this morning the euro has fallen again .
today , the fees paid for an over EUR 100 of EUR 100 within the market reach an average EUR 17.4 10 , which is many times the cost of domestic transfers .
in the long run , there must be no differences between cross @-@ border and national transfers .
in this report - which I now address directly to Mrs Peijs - legislative proposals are submitted to amend the 1997 directive , which entered into force last year .
in his wisdom , Parliament is entirely in agreement with you .
the small or medium @-@ sized enterprises is not simply a mini @-@ figure of a multinational group , and it is not enough to deduct the difficulties of a small @-@ scale enterprise in a purely quantitative way , in order to properly grasp the problems of large companies .
until recently , many young people thought about them , following their studies , after training , either to go to state or to larger enterprises , to be State @-@ free .
Mr President , Commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , from my eleven years of experience as a Member of Parliament , I know very well that the debates on small and medium @-@ sized enterprises in this House are neither new nor rare .
today , I would particularly like to say that the obstacles to the completion of the internal market are being systematically removed , if not altogether , systematically to improve the competitiveness of small and medium @-@ sized enterprises , thereby enabling them to develop more dynamic and sustainable development .
this is a major adjustment potential .
at the same time , we propose to launch a European area of innovation , and I am grateful to the rapporteur for being prepared to include this proposal in her report .
we are in agreement with the rapporteur , Mrs Mont , which rightly pays attention to small , medium @-@ sized and micro @-@ enterprises , as well as the priority support for young start @-@ to @-@ business companies .
my partner is for me the chief executive , and if I have a problem in terms of funding , a problem with European institutions , I can tell my entrepreneurs that there is someone who is competent and who knows about public procurement , through research programmes and research through infrastructure .
that is why we should aim to reduce as much as possible with leaner legislation with SLIM benchmarks and best practices in order to have a simple and proper regulatory framework for our businesses .
that reminds me of what the Commissioner told us a year ago about the United States experience , where there was no fear of failure and of the ancient Scottish saying : &apos; if it fails to do it for the first time , it is trying again and again &apos; .
in many of our 15 Member States , their self @-@ employed workers receive lower benefits in pensions , health insurance and occupational accident insurance .
therefore , we first need to think of the small people , &apos; think small first &apos; .
on the other hand , we must carefully reflect on how this or that initiative at European level can be handled in the best way possible .
the conclusions of the Tampere European Council stressed that countries of origin and transit of immigrants and refugees must cooperate , in this context , under the High Level Working Group on Asylum and Migration , six action plans , including the action plan for Albania and neighbouring regions .
taking all these issues into account , my report proposes implementation of the measures proposed in the action plan , an analysis of needs , as specified in the first part , referring to the most pressing problems , such as the development of the economy and democratic institutions , the creation of an infrastructure in Albania and subsequently the signing of agreements on the return of refugees and immigrants to the Union .
Mr President , the action plan states in its analysis that the status quo in Albania is worrying .
( applause )
the more densely populated we make our borders , the wild they become the actions of the gangs of traffickers .
people are of course hoping for better political representation , but today large sections of the population are afraid , fear and , above all , from escalating violence .
there is work , in Greece , for example , especially in the agricultural sector , which could no longer be exported without the Albanian immigrant .
there is currently a strong return to refugees , which actually runs counter to the lack of security , law and order .
the action plan for Albania and neighbouring regions can increase the stability there .
in view of the unacceptable events in the Province of the province , I believe that all of this obliges us to examine in detail the ability and will of Albania to accept the European criteria in force in the field of human rights and democratic freedoms , and thus to carefully weigh up and adapt our action plans and our many achievements to this country until it changes its policy .
I would like to say a second thing .
the General Affairs Council agreed in October last year to the first five action plans for Somalia , Sri Lanka , Afghanistan , Morocco and Iraq .
indeed , we had a very serious and self @-@ confident debate on the quality of European law and the application of the principle of subsidiarity .
we are expressly asking the Commission to consider the clear division of responsibilities between the EU and the Member States , as well as within the institutions .
Mr President , Commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , first and foremost I would like to thank the rapporteur , Mr Wuermeling , for the way in which he has worked his report .
we can accept this position , and the report reflects this spirit if it calls for the clarity of the law , for the simplicity of the law and proportionality in remedies to be applied to the public ends .
we would like to see more detail from the Commission in any proposal on the proper implementation of this principle so that it can make a real assessment in its annual report .
Mr MacCormick maintains - and rightly so - that I said that the principle of subsidiarity is political but political .
therefore , if it is the guarantor and no ruler , it immediately follows that the structure devised by Mr Wuermeling , which seeks to delegate delegated to the Member States in accordance with the principle of subsidiarity , must in any case be guaranteed by the Member States themselves continuing this process .
various speakers from the Group of the European People &apos;s Party have already spoken and have outlined the group &apos;s views .
that was not a point of order , but as rapporteur you did , I believe , have the right to express an opinion on the clarification of this point .
this directive could be 64 pages long , extremely detailed and mathematical and contain a lot of technical expertise .
&quot; better regulation : &quot; joint responsibility &quot; &#91; 1998 ) ( COM ( 1998 ) 7@@ 15 - C5 @-@ 0266 / 2000 - 1999 / 2@@ 197 ( COS ) &#93;
a fixed charge has been taken as part of the old system between purchases from purchases and selling to the old system .
the next item is the oral question ( B5 @-@ 0557 / 00 ) by Mr Varela Suanzes @-@ Carpegna , on behalf of the Committee on Fisheries , to the Commission , on the state of negotiations on a new fisheries agreement with Morocco .
having said that , we must reaffirm that we do not need any kind of agreement .
in our opinion , it is extremely important for Community fishermen to resume their activities to a level that is compatible with the obligation to maintain permanent resources .
as a representative of the German coast , I can understand the concern of fishermen and their families , who have literally been caught up in the Chamber and which has been going on for months .
we all knew from the outset that it would be a difficult negotiation .
agreements with third countries are very important for the Union , particularly for regions with large fishing ports .
we need radical changes in order to reduce global fishing and use a lower proportion of the fisheries budget for agreements with third countries .
and I can also understand that , on the European side , we are bound by the Euro @-@ Mediterranean partnership .
this Parliament was very right to be critical of the Commission in relation to the Morocco agreement , which was dealt with very hesitantly and with great naivety at the beginning .
Mr President , the absence of Mr Fischler , which is justified , as the chairman of the Committee on Fisheries has just explained , does not allow me to go into too much detail .
this means the recruitment of port services , of ship repair , of ship @-@ making and of the work of the canning and oil factories , which means that , at the moment , an entire economic sector has been paralysed as a result of this situation .
through this agreement and an annual salary of around EUR 125 million , some 500 vessels of the European Union , including 50 Portuguese , had access to Moroccan waters .
the information available is incomplete and makes little sense even though the negotiations - as it is called - have been continued with different and complicated turns .
fish stocks in the world must be protected .
however , we must also make it clear that relations between the European Union and the transitional countries situated on the borders of the EU , and this I include in particular North Africa , Turkey , Russia , the bridge functions in other parts of the world and other cultures on the borders of the European Union , are assuming that these states need special support .
it has found it very positive , so that it can be expected that the negotiations that will start on 30 October will be very constructive .
thank you , nevertheless , for these very interesting contributions .
the text would read : &apos; in the recital that the victims , the citizens of the European Union , were involved in lengthy and repeated disputes over the past 12 years , and that their justified expectations have been dashed .
we have had an enormous exchange of letters with those affected and found out with great expense of vast non @-@ relevant documents , whose help can be clearly demonstrated that some Italian universities have actually been treated unfairly with regard to the acquired financial entitlements in relation to salaries and the contributions to pension provision .
in the Italian system , there is no room for manoeuvre as far as university lecturers are concerned ; rather , they are involved in a public invitation to tender .
if the Commission had been really serious about this problem , it would have been resolved for years .
we are a small plenary session , because it is Friday morning , but it has to be noted and admitted that it is a matter that concerns all parties and the entire Union .
in a Kafkaesque way , the universities went so far as to put their names out of the internal telephone lists , of the Turk and from the universities &apos; websites .
I think the sentence is true : &apos; people who do not take themselves seriously will not be taken seriously .
we are waiting for a new judgment of the European Court of Justice on this aspect of the problem , so there are two aspects that I would not describe as different , but which have been slightly different .
the real problem is that we have a foreign language teacher , that is , someone who has excellent English knowledge and has a medical college of Italy to explain to students the Italian notions of &apos; heart &apos; , &apos; surgical treatment &apos; , &apos; liver disease &apos; etc . do not have the same rights and status as those who teach medicine .
I declare the session of the European Parliament adjourned , and I wish you a happy weekend .
in shock and in the grief of the 150 victims , we are united and share the pain of loved ones .
regarding the report by Mr Ceyhun , on behalf of the Committee on Citizens &apos; Freedoms and Rights , Justice and Home Affairs , I have two requests to make : a request from the Group of the European Socialists to refer this report back to the relevant committee , and a request by the Group of the Greens / European Free Alliance to postpone the report to a later part @-@ session .
( Parliament gave its assent ) Relating to Tuesday :
Madam President , my group has listened carefully to this proposal .
B ) Meeting of 29 and 30 November 2000 :
I indicated that I wanted to comment before the end of the debate on the agenda .
this is a very serious measure , aimed at reintroducing censorship again in Italy , for the time being for teachers , but perhaps soon in other areas too soon .
we also support the binding aspects of the framework decision , namely that the Member States are required to reach a joint outcome as regards their legislation and also that judicial control by the Court of Justice is possible .
Parliament must also be represented on Europol &apos;s management board and the appointment of the director of this body .
the issue of combating money laundering is specifically referred to in the recently amended Council Directive of 10 June 1991 , which our fellow Member , Lehne rapporteur , was rapporteur .
I can only say that what happened at the end was a great show on the part of the Council , but the amendments that we tabled and voted on here in this House , with a large majority , were not taken up in the mass .
on these issues , the rapporteurs have raised the issue of both the Protocol to the amendment of the Europol Convention and the improvement of legal assistance .
and of course it requires - and not just for procedural reasons - an identical definition of what crime is to be understood and what methods it uses in order to prevent it from moving from one country to another .
I would like to comment on the Karamanou report on Europol .
even now we have much too many police forces , and , if we have completed enlargement , there will be more of them , and our chances of combating organised crime are falling far short of what is needed .
we must ensure that those who have innocent victims of the fight against crime - perhaps we should describe it as collateral damage - are not completely isolated from their loved ones .
this is therefore another good example of this : in order to combat money laundering , we can challenge a matter which is not a privilege for lawyers but is an essential element of this right to defence , which , in turn , is , for its part , an element of our whole building , our European culture and identity .
we are the only ones who are in favour of measures to prevent money laundering , that is , we are in favour of the abolition of banking secrecy , the secrecy of business , we are publicly aware of the registration of the books of all banks and companies , as well as the right of all employees of these companies , to the rights of all consumers , all movements of capital against the interests of society .
according to the United Nations , this money will recover to a billion dollar a year as a result of money laundering .
as far as the compromise is concerned , either the article concerned refers to persons engaged in certain activities , and we do not need to talk about lawyers or other professions , or the fact that the article refers to &apos; lawyers &apos; is an attack on professional secrecy , even if one considers other areas of activity that are still very specific or bordering on them .
I believe that &apos; without delay &apos; is more demanding than granting a two @-@ month period of rejection of cooperation .
Mr President , Commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , it is part of the price of freedom that the democratic rule of law is often shrouded in law enforcement .
the relevant committee has followed me on this , and the indications are also gratifying from the Council .
that is what we want to achieve through our amendments .
no staff of Europol or Interpol could be actively involved in that country , and we did not understand how important it was for those concerned to be with a quick trial .
criminal law systems are among the most radical cultural manifestations of a society .
today Parliament is to adopt a position on close judicial cooperation to combat serious organised crime , which I consider to be a good thing .
Mr President , first of all , I would like to congratulate Mrs Gebhardt on her excellent report and to say that the Commission can agree with almost all points of her speech .
however , Eurojust is a network of coordination between national judges and public prosecutors , with a view to combating serious forms of crime at European level .
while this annual report makes it clear that the new Commission is to be held accountable and required to take account of it , it is , so to speak , an old past from a previous era .
my question to this effect to the Commission has shown courses of action but , unfortunately , no valid outcome has been shown to date .
Mr President , I welcome Mrs Langenhagen &apos;s report and I am happy to endorse its content .
in this context , I would like to stress that , given the Commission &apos;s detailed expertise , we cannot accept the fact that so much that we have decided was not carried out .
I would particularly like to thank Mrs Langenhagen for her very constructive report , but also the members of the Committee on Budgetary Control , the Committee on Fisheries , especially Mr Busk , the draftsman of the opinion .
I have , at the beginning of my term , set up an informal working group that deals with simplifying and improving procedures , and I have already had the opportunity to explain to the Committee on Industry , External Trade , Research and Energy .
this , however , is of course a responsibility ; it is up to the Court of Auditors to establish these contacts , but I can assure you that , in order to resolve these issues , there is a constructive climate between the Court of Auditors and the Commission services , and this is also true of Parliament .
this is also the Commission &apos;s wish , and I dare to hope that we will be able to implement this research programme in the best possible conditions , but it must also be implemented with the highest possible efficiency and be strictly controlled in terms of the use of funds .
Mr Bethell , this does not concern the approval of the Minutes , but I can tell you that the Conference of Presidents decided to award this year &apos;s Sakharov Prize to the Association of Association of Growth .
this Charter is also an expression of a common set of values for all candidate countries , for all states which wish to join this European Union and , in particular , in the field of social rights , a clear signal to the applicant countries to fulfil these social standards .
Madam President , ladies and gentlemen , ladies and gentlemen , first of all , on behalf of the Presidency , I would like to join in the European Parliament &apos;s condolences to the catastrophe that has taken place in Salzburg , and express our sympathy to the families of the victims of this exceptionally serious accident .
some Members of this House have already expressed the wish , in our previous debate , for further application of this procedure .
more generally , I would say that this text represents the greatest common advance in the area of the recognition of social rights , both because of the importance of the rights that have been established and because , for the first time , these rights are enshrined in the same text as civil and political rights , confirming the indivisibility of fundamental rights .
I would also like to draw attention to the points made in the general opinion of the European Trade Union Confederation , which , for the Presidency and probably also for the other institutions , are fundamental to the relationship between the Charter and the Social Agenda and the fact that the draft Charter adopted by the Heads of State and Government represents an important step towards a social Europe and a citizens &apos; Europe .
it was therefore right and proper that the European Parliament should have attached outstanding importance to the elaboration of a Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union and played a thorough and constructive role in its creation .
the citizens are clearly showing the fundamental rights they deserve , and the institutions , bodies and institutions of the European Union will make it clear which right they have to pay attention to and respect them when they act on behalf of the people of Europe .
our governments must achieve concrete results in Nice which they can offer to the citizens - the institutional issues are important but , as the President @-@ in @-@ Office of the Council and the Commissioner know well , they are difficult to sell to the public .
for one thing , it is a success , but for the others it is currently a disappointment .
the Charter cannot be used as an act of the French Presidency as a flagship on the pretext of creating yet another intergovernmental conference .
let us try to ensure that the Charter does not do the same thing .
we are now planning to take part in the murder of the Commission , which is suicidal , because last week the Commission itself joined the Council &apos;s proposals .
Madam President , first of all , I would like to express my sincere thanks to my friend , Mr Méndez de Vigo , who has spoken with me , because I have to chair Parliament immediately .
we simply have to recognize that , in the twenty @-@ first century , the concept of dignity requires the universality of rights in its indivisibility .
Madam President , there are a number of welcome points in the Charter .
the British Conservatives say &apos; no &apos; to us , at a time when we are trying to avoid getting rid of the institutions of the Union of Brussels , and when we are trying to get rid of those commitments which are binding on all the institutions and bodies of the Union under Article 51 , the British Conservatives say &apos; no &apos; .
the issue , however , is not to challenge the positive and negative aspects .
the second fascinating aspect is that we are currently discussing an issue - human rights and civil rights - in which the Union has no competence .
I fully agree with him on that .
as one of the speakers has said , we must , of course , conduct an information campaign on the Charter that can begin here in this Parliament .
it is also timely , in the light of the Commission , because it deals with issues such as bioethics , genetic protection and data protection , as well as access to information .
retrograde and obscurantist tendencies have once again prevailed over those in civil society and in the institutions who want fundamental rights to apply to everyone and to provide an effective and legally binding response to new issues such as the risks of science , the rights of the new citizens , the right to a healthy environment , and so on .
however , the purpose of this Charter is clearly to establish ever closer relations between the peoples of Europe .
the Charter is a balanced and solid foundation for enlargement .
let us take our rights seriously if we want them to be respected by the governments and guaranteed by the courts !
Mr President , the Charter we are approving is a piece of work to be proud of .
the European trade unions and NGOs have called for this .
in the short term , it should be much more important for the European Union to accede to the already existing European Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms of the Council of Europe .
let us take this path .
I believe that a very qualified job has been done .
there are , however , more effects , particularly on our internal legal order .
what is most frightening , however , is the possibility of suspending fundamental rights under Article 52 if the interests of the European Union are at stake .
in this regard , I would like to stress that , for the first time in a document of the European Union , it is clearly being made clear that the rights contained in the Charter are granted in their majority of everyone , irrespective of their nationality or their right to stay .
the Commissioner reminded us that the Charter was worded as though it would one day be binding .
here , too , the Charter is a high priority , establishing a right to good administration .
the Turkish citizens are aware that their entry into the European Union requires not only a painless review of their institutions and a partially legitimate defence of sovereignty , but also a radical change in their habits and their mentality .
Mr President , Commissioner , there are two reports to be debated today , and the Morillon report is more political in nature , while my report is more technical .
in this context , I do not doubt that the will of each of us to support Turkey in its progress towards democratisation will prevail .
the Presidency hopes that this special action programme on EIB loans will be adopted very quickly by the Council , if possible at the Ecofin meeting on 27 November 2000 .
finally , I must say that the Cyprus talks within the framework of the United Nations have also been resumed .
I must also tell you that I am convinced that the Turkish Government has the firm will to tackle the necessary reforms in the reform process .
I also very much welcome the proposals made in this report on the strengthening of parliamentary cooperation and the increased role of civil society .
nothing has been done to abolish the death penalty , almost nothing to anchor minorities and human rights on legal grounds , even though the signing of some UN conventions has been signed .
Mr President , the Group of the European Liberal , Democrat and Reform Party warmly welcomes the Morillon report , which we consider to be wise , open and convincing .
nobody here - and I do not at all - denies that there has been genocide of the Armenian Empire in the last era of the Ottoman Empire .
however , it is not just a question of meeting the Copenhagen criteria , but of vital democratic standards in any case .
we fully agree with this statement , but we note that the decision of the Helsinki European Council to grant Turkey candidate country status is not the result of the vital public and parliamentary debate , which is also called for in the explanatory statement .
the dignity of the people must not be allowed to prevail .
the Council will have to ask themselves whether it has not damaged this issue with the award of candidate status to Turkey than it has .
( Parliament adopted the legislative resolution )
that is why we abstained .
on the other hand , it can be held up in the countries where the legislation is more favourable .
if the Charter were to be adopted at the forthcoming summit in Nice - whether by incorporating it into the treaties or even a solemn proclamation - the latter would be tantamount to negative developments .
articles which interfere in the competences of the Member States .
while the countries of Europe are in an alarming demographic situation , the Charter deals with the issue of the family in a very superficial way .
the Charter refers to the European Court of Justice in policy making in such diverse areas as employment policy , rendition policy , immigration and the family .
I , personally , would have liked her social dimension to have been much more extensive !
I consider the charter to be an acceptable step forward .
the method chosen by the members of the Convention , as always , has led , if unanimity is required , to a minimum charter with great gaps and ambiguities .
not right , but &apos; right to work &apos; ; not a right to social protection or a home , but &apos; the right to social support and to &apos; home &apos; ; not a pension or a minimum income ; it is a &apos; entitlement to protection against unjustified dismissal &apos; .
first of all , the remarkable difference between the German and the French raises major questions about the concept of mental @-@ religious heritage .
that is the right to work , and the right to housing is not included .
however , we must oppose the campaign for a legally binding charter , which would only create legal uncertainty .
recently , Mr Ahern , our Prime Minister , clearly stated that the European Charter of Fundamental Rights should remain a political document and not become a legal document .
at the end of the day , the horse trading which inevitably results in a process of this kind became the choice between the concept of &apos; religious heritage &apos; of Europeans and the promotion of &apos; business freedom &apos; .
furthermore , these texts are all based on initiatives of the Member States , either included in the third pillar or under Article 67 of the Treaty , and in both cases the Commission does not have the sole right of initiative .
with the Marinho report , the principle of mutual recognition of the mutual recognition of national measures for the freezing , freezing and confiscation of crime witnesses and the proceeds of crime will be extended to decisions taken before the judgment , in particular , allowing the competent authorities to act swiftly to ensure evidence and seizure of assets that could easily be transferred .
it was agreed that the principle of mutual recognition should also apply to the competent courts , which relate to the rules of the main negotiations , to be applied in particular , which would enable the competent authorities to gather evidence quickly and to seize ill @-@ pressed property .
we welcome the initiative of the French Presidency , whose aim is to improve the cooperation between the national authorities responsible for combating money laundering and to establish a uniform penalty .
while I welcome closer cooperation between the police forces of the individual Member States and Europol , I share the concern of the rapporteur about the lack of democratic control over Europol .
however , I would like to draw your attention to possible criminal reforms that may be carried out in some countries - for example , in Spain , under the Group of the People &apos;s Party - by using a certain economic situation , because these reforms do not relieve us of the concern for the Europe of freedoms and democracy .
Langenhagen report ( A5 @-@ 0310 / 2000 )
Mr President , if Turkey were a member of the EU today , it would occupy the second place among the most populous Member States in Germany .
in this case , the consultation procedure has been applied and , of course , it would be more appropriate to have a codecision procedure , as these decisions may in practice lead to a budgetary correction .
that is why I appreciate the frankness that is generally characteristic of Mr Morillon &apos; s report , although I believe that a conditional presentation on certain points would have provided a clearer picture of the criteria for evaluating Turkey ’ s progress towards accession .
from this point of view , it is appropriate to condemn the military bombardments of the Turkish air force , as well as highlighting the Turkish Government &apos;s commitment to promoting the negotiations between Turkish and Greek Cypriots without preconditions .
almost 40 % of Cyprus &apos;s territory is occupied by foreign troops , that is to say by Turkish soldiers .
we have to say - and this is also evident in Mr Morillon &apos;s report - that this is not the case sufficiently .
we want to accompany them in this way , they do not impede them and , above all , respect our financial commitments .
how much more desirable and acceptable would be the goal of a loose community of nation states promoting free trade and acting in a limited number of policy areas , and how much simpler it would be for a country such as Turkey to be taken into account .
we can only share this concern , which , moreover , the Commission expressed fully in its last annual report .
the new one is the accession partnership , and there is a very important provision in the accession partnership , which states that the candidate country will have to deal with all the issues that are dealt with in the progress report .
the vote will take place tomorrow at 11.30 a.m.
the difficult situation in the Middle East is therefore no reason to correct the objectives of the Marseille conference .
there is also a wide range of cooperation to combat illegal trade , migrations and strengthen the rule of law .
today , on the eve of Marseille , the French Presidency has , of course , wanted this Mediterranean priority for the Union to be confirmed financially .
what that means is that this is not just a chance for more trade and change , but is , to a very large extent , pure security policy , and we must make it clear to our citizens to gain acceptance for it .
it is also true that setbacks in the run @-@ up to the peace process slowed down the Barcelona Process .
in the field of human rights , we are proposing a structured approach in which we look at the development of the countries in question .
the Council adopted a joint EU strategy for the Mediterranean at its meeting in Feira in June 2000 , and the European Commission , having proposed and implemented the reform of the MEDA Regulation , recently presented a document on the intensification of the Barcelona Process .
I would go even further and say that what we have seen in the past was an alibi not only for Europe but also for the Mediterranean partner countries .
none of this is very clear .
furthermore , the dream of peace on both sides of the Mediterranean must immediately be prioritised and put into practice .
the thousands of forms of the Mediterranean world , the ancient civilisations , which have been characterised by the twin shores of the sea by the two shores of the sea , now have the chance to embark on a common path that will create real opportunities for progress and development in the economic and social spheres , through dialogue and political determination .
moreover , it can contribute to the resumption of talks in the Middle East , through its continuity , which may be the best possible but also significant but important .
it is true that this conference is taking place in the context of violence and a crisis of the peace process as a result of the Middle East conflict , but it is absolutely true that it offers the possibility of preserving the flame of the Euro @-@ Mediterranean process and not transferring the tragic conflict to this process .
the Commission and the Council have expressed their readiness to do this .
furthermore , I believe that we are overlooking another important issue : the environment .
we now have a regulation which I believe will enable the European Union to provide aid efficiently and on time and to use EU funds properly in the countries of the Western Balkans .
that is why I am calling for a balance between the visibility of this regulation - by which I mean large @-@ scale projects - and further promotion of democratisation projects , security projects , projects which are often not so visible , but which are all the more necessary for the stability of the Balkans .
Mr President , Commissioner , I am aware that the Balkans is not an area where there is cause for optimism .
we need to provide more effective and better coordinated assistance , by combining all the fragmented elements .
I think it is clear to all of us that it will only be possible to consolidate the good work that the Kosovo Agency has been doing in recent months in order to build up the good work that the Kosovo Agency can do in recent months .
I believe that this is counter @-@ productive , and I am sure that Mr Jacques Langer will use all his possibilities , and if Mr Moscovici would be here , he might also do so .
however , this week , in my view , the main prize goes to the leaders of the Social Democrats in Bosnia and , incidentally , to the Slovak population , who did not fall into the referendum held by the opposition to the government , but this is another chapter .
I hope it will reflect the consolidation of democracy during the parliamentary elections on 23 December in Serbia .
in the opinion of the Council , closer ties with the Union are , in any case , closely linked to the development of regional cooperation .
the French Presidency has set itself ambitious targets for the Western Balkans : the development of the stabilisation and association process , the adoption of the CARDS programme and the adoption of asymmetric trade preferences , to name only the most important Community measures .
further objectives for the Zagreb Summit should be the announcement of Community aid and reconstruction , democratisation and stabilisation programmes for the Western Balkans , confirming the gradual creation of a free trade area between the European Union and the Western Balkans , as well as the commitment of the countries in the region to develop cooperation among themselves and establish a regional free trade system .
this is absolutely essential .
for several months , James Baker &apos;s mission has been pursuing a dual objective : to try to dispel the difficulties involved in implementing the plan for a settlement of the self @-@ determination of a referendum of the poor people , and at the same time to reach a political agreement .
Mr President , Mr President @-@ in @-@ Office of the Council , I believe that the EU would have much greater influence in the Maghreb , if its links were even stronger in Morocco .
what diplomatic initiatives does the Council intend to take in the interests of rapprochement with Armenia / Azerbaijan , the resolution of their bilateral differences and the promotion of their cooperation ?
I understand the views expressed by the two Members and I do not have much to add to what the Union has done .
Mr President , I welcome the Council &apos;s response to the original question .
the new legislation under preparation in Turkey , which is supposed to ban a reduction in penalties , is necessary , but it is more important for Muslim leaders to distance themselves from the murder of victims , which is a direct violation of Islam .
it does not matter whether they have sinned voluntarily or involuntarily , that is to say a rape .
the Austrian Government is the legitimate government of a Member State of the European Union .
I just wanted to say that there was no discrimination against one country or another .
when you say that extreme right @-@ wing parties in Austria are prohibited , that is a good thing , but we can also wonder what is and what is not right .
the question of a political settlement on Cyprus , which you have raised , Mr Alavanos , will , of course , remain on the agenda in the talks with Turkey , which is what we committed ourselves to in Helsinki .
as the author is not present , Question No 11 lapses .
my response should not be so optimistic or hope , but that the French EU Presidency is willing to reach a good agreement .
it also attempted to specify a negotiating agenda .
the sister of another constituent from my constituency wrote a letter to me to draw attention to the fact that her brother is in prison due to a similar suspicion since 28 March 2000 .
given developments in the oil markets , it is necessary for the EU to pursue a more dynamic energy policy , as the Council believes it will be able to achieve a reduction in the dependency of the European economy of oil ?
the measures referred to by the honourable Member are in the draft budgetary law which President Clinton signed on 28 October 2000 .
I also recognised that the Cuban Government has taken measures to better integrate the country economically into the region , and has expressed the wish of Europe to act as a partner in Cuba in this process .
secondly , in its response to NATO , the Council points out that it is Pontius Pilate , without taking a stance on the provocative infringement of Greek sovereignty by Turkey , an act that was shown this time by NATO .
they often blame the European Union , they promise countries that have affected various natural disasters or destruction , but they delay the fulfilment of these economic promises so much that they either give the impression of giving them the promises they have made , or when it is made available , if it is made available , far too late .
fourthly , what is most important to us is to build new borders , but there are those who rush the borders very easily , namely all criminal organisations with criminal activities .
in this respect , I do not think it helpful to raise another issue which was concluded around a year ago with Mrs Pack &apos;s report in connection with the headquarters of the Agency for Reconstruction .
we have to realise that the road to peace in the Balkans is still a long one , and that there are still potential friction which can put us back into the past .
I would like to focus on the regulations .
seventy per cent of the appropriations committed were awarded and 43 % of the funds allocated were paid out .
we consider such a reference in the preamble to be more useful than in the article on conditionality .
the language regime is another sore point .
that was the background to these summits .
in the social and cultural field , the Heads of State and Government reaffirmed the importance of closer cooperation in the area of education and defining specific initiatives aimed at promoting mutual information , including the development of cooperation between universities and the electronic networking of schools .
if political and economic development in the multipolar world is in the long @-@ term , Asian relations are central to Europe and vice versa .
we have fewer problems with ASEM III , because projects involving money laundering , HIV and AIDS , food safety and the like are , of course , welcome .
it is therefore a priority for the European Union to equip itself with the necessary mechanisms to ensure full and adequate participation .
Mr President , there is no doubt that the best , if not the only guarantee for the management of global fish stocks , is today the regional fisheries organisations .
overfishing , the pollution of our seas , climatic changes - in particular the conference in The Hague - as well as physical changes in our environment demonstrate increasing pressure on this finite resource .
it is still the case that the law of the jungle prevails in the high seas .
first of all , I welcome the report and say that the subject of the management , control and conservation of fish stocks is a major problem .
I would ask the Commission to take this into account .
as regards the duration of the implementation of the decisions of the regional fisheries organisations , I agree with you that the Commission &apos;s assessment can and must be improved .
we should therefore reflect on new instruments to combat any serious crises that may occur in spite of very high internal demand and the good use of export opportunities .
the creation of a compensation fund would significantly accelerate the concentration of European slaughter pig production because the risk of increased capital investment would be transferred to the joint fund .
it does not overcome the cyclical instability of the sector , it breaks with the principle of financial solidarity of the CAP and represents a clear element of renationalisation and distortion of competition .
if all common market organisations were to be as anti @-@ cyclical as what Mr Garot proposed , or if all of the market organisations were effective in favour of the smaller farms , as Mr Busk said just now , we would have another structure for farms in Europe .
the latest reported cases of BSE will result in a reduction in production and will , in the past , be in the shadows .
the participation of all Member States in this new system must be compulsory .
I am convinced that this instrument will provide for greater stability for the market and will open up the possibility for farmers in Europe to cope with cyclically recurring crises .
as Mrs Keppelhoff @-@ Wiechert said , there is traditional pig cycles .
if we opt for a market organisation and a strengthening of the relevant policy , I would rather provide producer organisations better , so that they place a firmer position on the market , in a market whose demand side is becoming more and more and more on the line .
however , other countries do not want the compensation fund , and I have to tell you quite honestly that if we were now to propose a forced introduction of the compensation fund , the consequence would be that we could forget all this because there would never be a majority in the Council for this .
but the title reads : &apos; the proposal for a Council regulation amending Regulation ( EEC ) No 75 / 75 on the common organisation of the market in pigmeat &apos; .
there are four focal points in the various chapters of the annual report .
in the Community programmes which are implemented directly by the Commission , such as on internal policies and with regard to external relations , implementation rates were somewhat lower .
therefore , in its programme for 2001 , the Court of Auditors envisages a full examination of the Commission &apos;s recovery procedures in all the budget areas .
however , I am quite amazed if the Member States , for example in the area of customs duties , refuse to accept financial liability if errors were made by their administrations and if tariffs are unsustainable , and then do not take up this shortfall of income , but must all be responsible for loss of income together with all the Member States .
when , at the end of last year , the initial desired aims of humanitarian aid were not carried out with adequate control and control measures , the Commission decided to stop the action despite resources being available .
you , Commissioner Schreyer , promised us when you took office that you would try to do this .
Madam President , first of all , many thanks to the Court of Auditors for the annual report .
I would like the Court of Auditors &apos; annual report to be much more specific , more figures and facts .
the Commission &apos;s reform aims to make the various Directorates @-@ General responsible , and I would like to ask the Court of Auditors whether it intends to structure the annual report differently , in line with the classification of chapters by the various directorates @-@ general .
I would therefore ask you to take the floor again .
I am pleased that the Commission has taken measures to improve its management and control of Community finances and , at the same time , to introduce appropriate systems in the Member States .
the reform of the Commission does not guarantee that the irregularities identified will not occur in future .
Madam President , I too welcome the presence of the representatives of the Council , because I too would like to say a few words about them .
can you , Mr Karlsson , assure us that you will meet this demand in the future , and it is very difficult for us to exert pressure in the right areas on those who are blatantly violating the rules if no clear information is made in the Court of Auditors &apos; annual report .
in order to achieve this objective , I would like you , Madam President , to show great leadership and I would like to express my thanks for the commitment you have already shown .
however , they do not write it into the report , and I am tired of hearing for years that 80 % is the responsibility of the Member States and we are only 20 % and , at the same time , it is not included in writing .
we must analyse the workings of the Court of Auditors and see how its independence can be strengthened by the institutions and the programmes that it is intended to examine .
however , we are confronted with a complex system .
in one case or another it is a small number of countries or a small number of economic operators who are the direct beneficiaries of these measures .
I would , however , like to make it clear that this procedure can only be developed gradually , and that it will not be a complete change to the method of data collection , because it will no longer be possible to meet the requirements laid down in the Treaty .
the Court of Auditors fully agrees with Parliament that it is not just a matter of reforming the Commission or financial control by Parliament .
I too have met with the events in Florida this morning , Mr van Hulten , and I am glad that I am not responsible for examining the electoral process in that state .
I would like to give you an example : in banning exports of products as unsafe in third countries , there was difficulties for the Council , while this ban is very important to the European Parliament , and we fully support it .
I am therefore extremely grateful to the Group of the European People ’ s Party ( Christian Democrats ) and European Democrats for incorporating these amendments here today and to bring them back to the discussion in plenary .
we must , of course , ask the question of the extent to which the current standards exist in Europe and European standards .
we are only at first reading .
we must no longer ignore the link between products and services .
furthermore , we support the extension of the directive proposed by the Commission to services and the inclusion of products on the consumer market within the scope of the directive , although more could be done in these areas , but that is something we will probably have to deal with in the future .
finally , it is to be hoped that the Commission will link and develop existing Community legislation in order not only to make it more transparent , but also to make it truly effective , in line with its clarity .
that is certainly a good thing .
the scope of the directive must be limited to the many national and Community rules on product products , which also cover the same safety aspects .
a huge effort has been made to better define the interaction between the sectoral legislation applicable to certain product groups and this new horizontal directive , so that a really satisfactory outcome has been achieved .
the directive will not , however , be applied if specific sectoral legislation is available to deal with these aspects .
I am therefore pleased that these important principles in the Commission &apos;s proposal are supported in Mrs González Álvarez &apos;s report .
this justification is necessary in order to avoid excessive bureaucracy .
amendment No 19 provides for the harmonisation of the Member States &apos; practices and monitoring programmes on the basis of guidelines drawn up by the Commission with the support of the advisory committee .
amendments 30 , 32 , 42 and the vast majority of Amendment No 33 propose rewording the existing text of the directive , which is not the subject of the review .
if the review concludes that the product concerned is safe , the export ban will automatically be lifted .
I should like to tell you that although the Technical Group of Independent Members of the European Liberal , Democrat and Reform Party has now joined the Technical Group of Independent Members , the Technical Group of the European People &apos;s Party ( Christian Democrats ) has moved from the Technical Group to the Group of the European Parliament .
( Parliament adopted the legislative resolution )
( Parliament adopted the legislative resolution )
unfortunately , we cannot welcome this yet .
the delay in the application of the agreements is only partially justified .
in writing . - ( PL ) Mr President , I welcome this report by Mr Mann on a proposal to provide funds to Greece in order to reduce interest rates on the basis of EIB loans intended for the reconstruction of Attica damaged by the earthquake in September 1999 .
but every affirmation of &apos; equality between men and women &apos; is punished by the European directive allowing women to work on night work .
we would have preferred it to be examined in advance of this Fifth Action Programme .
given that these NGOs play an integrated role in the preparation and implementation of this programme , I believe that the integrity of this Community framework strategy for equality between men and women is called into question and therefore cannot be supported by NGOs .
- While I support this report on general product safety , we must not go too far .
we support this position in all respects , as well as the two proposals for regulations of the Council to flesh out this course of action , but we cannot endorse the amendments tabled by the European Parliament which seek to radically alter the balance of the system in favour of the Commission .
Mr President , I voted in favour of the report , although it does not make clear enough of the distinction between Kosovo , Serbia and Montenegro .
we are opposed to new subsidies for pig meat production and we are therefore voting against the report .
the Garot report is aimed at improving the Commission &apos;s proposal in a number of respects by trying to find a compromise solution with the Council , in particular with regard to financial participation in the Fund .
the pigmeat market is characterised by cyclical fluctuations .
this House speaks a lot of rights - only yesterday we adopted the Charter of Fundamental Rights - but when it comes to the application , not even practical implementation , but merely highlighting those rights , it is frightened of withdrawal , which is not worthy of it .
it is excellent that the European Parliament is discussing Turkey &apos;s progress towards accession , especially when it comes to respect for human rights .
at a time when the last witnesses in exile and the last survivors of the carnage are taking place quietly from us , the task of remembrance and duty to remember must be made all the more compelling .
then there will be another question as to whether they want to become a member of the European Union or whether they prefer to seek an integrated association with other countries in the Middle East which in the areas of trade and economy , security and stability and human rights and democratic rules would be closely linked to the European Union .
these countries were once in Turkish territory and riots have always been violently suppressed .
the Armenian people were deported to the desert of Mesopotamia . healthy men have been shot ; women , children and old people have been displaced and killed in Istanbul , with 600 murders of Armenians ; more than 1 million Armenians have been wiped out more than a million in a little more than a year , which is almost half the Ottoman Armenian population .
it is for precisely this reason that we rejected the amendments on the Armenian genocide .
on the whole , our interests are , ultimately , weakened and not defended with the required force , and the role of the Commission is , above all , to play off the instructions of the Member States so that they will also implement the obligatory decisions that have sometimes been taken against their will in the relevant regional organisation .
I do not wish to take up the excellent argument put forward by my friend Mr Gallagher on the text on which we are to vote , but I wish to extend the debate to all the cases in which our countries will be represented by the implementing Commission in international negotiations .
summary of dangerous and non @-@ hazardous waste in a single directive has , at the end of the day , been a comprehensive piece of work .
fortunately , there has been progress in technology , which must , above all , be used as far as sustainability is concerned .
despite all this , this third reading is to be welcomed because it tightens up the conditions for operating an operating licence .
I believe that they will make an important contribution to improving the environment .
it is important that we do not replace waste with an unhealthy and harmful form of waste .
I am very pleased about this , because this task for a new Member , which is directly in favour of the second reading , was not easy .
public access to information has been improved .
the social systems are facing general trends , in particular , with the consequences of a low growth rate of over 25 years , which has led to unemployment , marginalisation and the ageing of the population , the development of new diseases and , last but not least , progress in the field of research and treatment , resulting in an increase in the cost of health .
it should also be a proposal for recommendations on the following points : recognition by the Member States of a common approach to the universal service provision , which enables all European citizens to provide guarantees for respect for the principle of non @-@ discrimination ; for the inclusion of persons and groups of serious diseases including the cost and incentive for private insurers to participate in the development of preventive measures .
an important objective of modernising social protection today is to guarantee , among other things , health protection .
that is what a social Europe is , and that should differentiate us from others : the United States , for example :
but the country must be able to decide for itself on the choice of the system , and it is not correct that the EU should regulate these matters .
I sought medical assistance and received it that three weeks would have to wait for an investigation date and then at least one month for the inevitable operation .
even though more and more Europeans are resorting to additional insurance companies in order to reduce their self @-@ financing , the market statute is still the best guarantee of equal access to medical care .
this element is now particularly in recital J , as well as in paragraph 11 ( e ) and f ) and 14 of this report .
furthermore , increased labour mobility in the European Union is a necessity and provides an additional argument for the submission of a Green Paper on health insurance and the measures to be taken in this area .
above all , in paragraph 3 of the report , the report draws attention to major problems with the long @-@ term maintenance of public health care systems throughout the EU , which face the rising costs of modern treatments and the growing need for an ageing population .
in this respect , I think it is most important for us to come forward with the Commission study on the existing systems , as well as another study by the Commission on the American system and the systems in other countries , so that we can have a clearer idea of these things .
I have to say that I am prejudiced on this issue because , as far as I am aware , you are a chief inspector in a hospital with a white stick , a code of ethics and a hammer to bring the patients to their knees .
in order to avoid misunderstandings , however , I would like to stress that the present report concerns additional health insurance and not health care as such , although both of these cannot be separated from one another .
this is a classic example of socialist interventionism .
these figures are somewhat misleading , however , as both the concept and the cover vary significantly from one country to another .
24 % of the population live in poverty , and the main causes are low wages , vulnerable and poorly paid jobs , pensions and pensions which are so low that they do not ensure a minimum living for workers and their families .
if this technical assistance is incorporated into the programme itself , the Commission takes the view that the Commission &apos;s complaints are unfounded .
updating the stability programmes of Germany , Finland and the Netherlands
an increasing number of states are reaching balanced , or even clearly , positive budgets .
as far as the Netherlands is concerned , the Commission is concerned about other issues , such as the adaptation of the policy mix and the risks associated with the impact of fiscal stimulus , in a period of strong economic growth , which could lead to overheating in the Netherlands .
Mr President , Commissioner , we are grateful to you , Commissioner , for this report that you have given us on the development of the net beneficiaries in the European Union .
Mr President , I am also pleased about the positive development of public finances in the countries affected , but I have seen that many people are beginning to feel concerned about price stability in Europe .
I would like to know , Commissioner , whether the Commission can make recommendations in this respect .
the Council of the European Union , in cooperation with your institution and the European Commission , also plays an active role in updating and constantly strengthening European rules on prevention and combating this disease .
the control instruments are being strengthened throughout the whole of the food chain .
the European Food Safety Authority will also provide clear and comprehensible information on the issues that fall within its remit .
if these controls are observed and implemented , the risk to the population will be reduced to a minimum .
the Commission &apos;s view that targeted tests are important to obtain a true picture of the actual incidence of BSE in the Community was confirmed by the test results in France .
specified risk material ( FYROM ) must be removed and destroyed .
I should like to add a few more words on this .
in this context , I also welcome the announcement by Prime Minister Jospin yesterday that the controls on the food chain should be intensified considerably , including an increase in staffing levels .
however , transposition in the Member States is still too slow .
I would like to make it clear to you , ladies and gentlemen , that what we need is two things .
in a situation which has arisen in France and previously in many other countries , it is necessary to be able to explain to consumers where the products they buy originate and how they can be traced .
Mr Böge , who now claim that there are no cases of BSE in their territory , has not been properly monitored .
we must therefore take urgent steps to reassure consumers and restore their confidence in food safety .
I am not going to make a detailed list of the errors committed by one side or the other .
in this respect , I believe that the measures taken by the French Government are inadequate .
but , above all , bad agreements need to be improved , especially if public health is required to do so .
however , in the face of this crisis , we must guarantee both the health and food safety of consumers as well as the income of livestock farmers , as well as the income of the butchers of butchers , dealers and distributors , who have all become the victims of the negligence of the national and Community authorities .
Madam President , Mr President @-@ in @-@ Office of the Council , Commissioner , this debate reminds us of the differences of opinion between us all , between the Council on the one hand and the Commission on the other .
reform of the CAP is not only necessary , it is essential because it is unacceptable for a country to take drastic measures and to create difficulties for its economy .
then we should not have to complain now that you would be classified into a category that would not have been classified as BSE , because you simply claim to be BSE @-@ free .
for the costs of the crisis not to be imposed solely on breeders , we call for financial support measures in their favour .
let me point out , however , that no human being can live a day without food .
Mr Byrne , in contrast to the general opinion , did not say a great deal today about the tests .
firstly , we will need to set out very high controls and precautions in order to meet the valid and demanding demands of European consumers in the area of food safety .
just start talking about what we have decided , then we do not need to talk about these matters .
consumers and producers must therefore join forces in order to improve safety in relation to the sacrosanct principle of food safety .
if we had had the political will , I can assure you that this is not the problem today , because the heart of the problem is known .
secondly , there is the whole question of whether or not a meal in animal feed may be used in animal feed .
we are becoming more and more frequent in my country that a dead sheep or a dead calf will not be disposed of , because the costs are too high .
the British system to remove infected animals from the herds and to pay proper compensation for these animals encourages farmers to declare their cases of BSE .
Commissioner Byrne was very firm today when he indicated in his opening statement to Parliament his willingness to look at this issue with the animal meal and to accept it .
you will take us forward , and that is why I have listened carefully to everything you have said because , at the moment , it seems urgent to me to decide on these issues as regards the safety of our fellow citizens at European level .
when discussing this issue , we must remember that there is already a ban on feeding animal meal to cattle .
the tests I am now discussing are somewhat different .
in view of the number of examples of infringement of the most fundamental human rights for the expulsion of immigrants recently in various Member States , the Commission should pay particular attention to this issue .
Mr President , I would like to say that I share the concerns of the honourable Member and hope that this appeal will be addressed not only to the Commission but also to the Council , so that we will have adopted the whole legal framework by June of next year .
what measures does the Commission intend to take in order to end this intolerable situation of shameful exploitation , ill @-@ treatment and trafficking in human beings and to eradicate all discrimination at the expense of women ?
will the Commission take measures to put an end to the current differences of opinion which are so damaging to the euro ?
I would ask you , ladies and gentlemen , to begin with the question and not with the explanation .
the Commission , therefore , recently sent a statement to the Greek authorities .
if values are exceeded , the Member State , in this case Greece , must take action .
in its decision on the approval of the French regime to promote film production , the Commission had laid down four specific compatibility criteria .
however , I do not think we should be satisfied with what has been achieved .
firstly , by improving the perception of exclusion by introducing indicators and assessment criteria , which mainly refer to the target groups .
the best way to prevent social exclusion is to get paid work , but I would rather agree with those who think that employment alone is not a guarantee of social participation .
there may also be elderly people who no longer have any need of knowledge .
where this was also done in Europe , unemployment has been significantly reduced .
moreover , according to the EU statistical service , 18 % of European citizens live below the poverty line , while one third of these people live in poverty .
every year , I work with my friends Thomas Mann and Mario Mantovani to spend on the wretched city of Brussels to spend time on dinner , bleeding our hearts and hearts , because we want to do it just over a year : we would like to do it every day , but , to be honest , we cannot do that .
it is an ambitious Community action programme which , according to the Commission proposal , will have a budget of EUR 70 million over a period of five years .
finally , I should like to reaffirm that solidarity between the Member States must be an essential reference to , of course , a new fight against poverty and social exclusion , bearing in mind that the economic progress of the Member States , and consequently their greater prosperity , will undoubtedly lead to more social justice through the application of a major economy economy .
I agree with you on the importance of better understanding of social exclusion and poverty , as well as promoting comparable indicators and assessment criteria .
however , in response to your request , I would like to make the following pragmatic suggestion , because I fully agree with you that we need to find a way of close and continuous cooperation .
electricity from renewable energy sources
we do not have that time .
let me make one thing clear : the incineration of waste is not a renewable energy source , and can therefore not contribute to the objective of achieving it .
we believe that the effects on the environment of these guidelines will be very negative if they are not changed .
colleagues , this directive makes sense .
since the final applications from the Advocate @-@ General before the Court of Justice in Luxembourg , the risk of fixed prices has been reduced by state aid rules .
after all , we do not want others to believe that burning peat produce less carbon dioxide , but peat is a domestic raw material , while gas and oil need to be imported .
oil is not manufactured by coal , natural gas or uranium .
we favour a shorter @-@ term review , followed by a review , which I would like to say to my fellow Member , Mrs McNally , but I have to draw attention to the fact that , given the technical difficulties and the costs associated with this technology , it will still be a long way off the road .
this directive goes in the desired direction , of course : to achieve the sustainable use of renewable energy sources at last .
Mr President , I would like to thank Mrs Rothe for the valuable work she has done in producing this report .
with regard to sustainable energy , we have set ourselves ambitious targets , but we are still modest in relation to the climate problem .
Mr President , there is no doubt that a combination of investments in renewable energy sources and energy efficiency is the only realistic way for the European Union to meet the requirements of the Kyoto Protocol and reduce our heavy dependence on fossil fuels .
we must vote by a large majority in favour of Mrs Rothe &apos;s proposals .
as far as our objectives in this area are concerned , we must listen to the citizens and go beyond the Commission proposal of 21 % , which I believe to be very positive overall , and will increase the proportion of renewable energy in overall production .
amendments 1 , 2 , 8 , 20 and 21 underline the need for a policy in favour of green electricity and its many benefits , and can be directly accepted by the Commission .
in this respect , we support Amendments Nos 36 and 56 and also some aspects of Amendments Nos 4 , 15 and 62 , linked to the idea of the internalisation of external costs and the compensation of the external costs that are not covered by renewable energy sources .
participation of women in conflict resolution
women must be fully involved in all peace talks , reconstruction and all peace @-@ keeping initiatives .
for women , the situation is also particularly difficult when they continue to fight for recognition and equal participation .
the saga of some male Members of this House against a serious treatment of this issue has come to a head on the wall .
we could also discuss the involvement of the NGOs , the building of facilities for people in need , etc . we could then conduct hearings , seminars , etc. on these issues .
we agree that the rape , forced pregnancy , forced sterilisation and any other form of sexual violence must be recognised as crimes against humanity , and so the texts must be updated in order to protect women effectively .
( the President cut off the speaker )
once again , I wish to express my congratulations on this subject , where I hope something will come out of it .
the report not only refers to the social exclusion of women as a problem , but also quite rightly stresses that protection against crime and personal security can no longer be guaranteed only within the borders of the nations .
in this area , there are nothing further than shameful failures , and yet we are still faced with a wall of female marginalisation .
acts of systematic rape and sexual slavery are being condemned in the heat of the battle .
fourth example : the important role of women in the peace process that the European Community has supported in the Balkans and in the Mediterranean .
Mr President , we are moving towards a more everyday problem , namely the legislation applicable to domestic work in private homes , because that is what it is all about .
finally , all this will necessarily involve financial intervention by the public sector , whether in tax or on a fiscal basis , because a private budget may not pay full status , even if it is limited , and then they will continue to be on the black market .
workers , in the majority of women , should have access to education and training .
Mr President , Commissioner , I should like to begin by thanking the rapporteur .
Mr President , Commissioner , household budgets , which used to be more than exclusively responsible budgets , have now become necessary and indispensable support for workers and men and , above all , single mothers and elderly people .
the vote will be held tomorrow at 12 noon .
Mr President , we hope that , in your speech , you will discuss the future development of this cooperation and the newly acquired friendship that we will build in the future , and I am very pleased to be able to give you the floor now .
we need not only to privatise our centralised economy , but also to create a legal system that guarantees freedom of corporate governance and the whole economic process .
as regards the relations between Serbia and Montenegro within the federal state , the former undemocratic organisation of the Republic of Yugoslavia has seriously threatened the functioning of the state .
then , of course , your brave forefathers devoted to an uncertain project which brought historic results .
approval of the Minutes of the previous sitting
Mr President , my concern is rather more to the future than to the past , and I would like to make sure that the BSE vote is taking place at today ’ s sitting .
at the beginning of this part @-@ session I even submitted a complete own @-@ initiative report to the Committee on Constitutional Affairs .
of course , this right must be set limits , and that is what we are talking about today .
Mr President , the right of Members of Parliament to have access to secret documents is an important matter , but it cannot replace the citizens &apos; direct right of access to information .
these are considerations that led the Committee on Budgetary Control to deliver an opinion in this procedure .
his knowledge depends on the assessment of the media , or of special interest groups , in relation to the institutions , that it is often powerless .
however , what is at stake here is public access , not Parliament , documents .
we have therefore reduced the number to six .
in addition , a report is to be presented annually to Parliament so that we are kept informed of progress and abuses .
the rules on the obligation to inform the Commission and the Council to the European Parliament do not belong in this draft legislation .
in other words , I believe that a link is made between the rights of the Members and the rights of citizens .
turning now to our concerns : the first concerns the areas of common foreign and security policy , but also of justice and home affairs .
the principle of the regulation is to be welcomed in a positive way , in particular the clarification that this regulation extends to all policy areas and to all the institutions of the Union .
Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , I would appeal to you to put pressure on the Council to change its mind and , at the same time , to ask you to vote in favour of the Cashman report .
Mr President , first of all I would like to thank the rapporteur and everyone else who has been involved in this work .
one final point : secrecy is such that it is so great for the Members of this Parliament that many connections for their decision @-@ making , which we also need , are hidden away from the fact that we are ...
we MEPs should have more courage .
it would be better to include the articles themselves , which oblige all the institutions to make their documents available and to establish the relevant registers .
this gulf illustrates the distance between the European Union and its citizens .
I would like to add that I appreciate the efforts of the rapporteur , Mr Cashman , and the draftsman of the opinion , Mrs Maij @-@ Weggen , to have presented this report in such a short space of time .
this demonstrates , in my opinion , that there is no such thing as perfect and that we must all work together to avoid situations of this kind .
these include amendments such as those that must be decided by interinstitutional agreement : No 34 , 45 and 48 .
I make that remark because the Commissioner present , normally , gives the explanations of vote to the Commission orally .
the vote will take place at 12 noon .
we in the committee agree with some restraint with the role of the external ratings @-@ related role proposed by the Commission , provided that there are restrictions on this role - particularly that smaller companies do not have to be ratings and without any disadvantage without ratings .
( Parliament adopted the resolution )
report ( A5 @-@ 0318 / 2000 ) by Mr Cashman on the proposal for a regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council on public access to documents of the European Parliament , the Council and the Commission ( COM ( 2000 ) 30 - C5 @-@ 0057 / 2000 - 2000 / 0032 ( COD ) )
the majority of women here in Parliament are going to a conference with parliamentarians to Berlin .
with a vote tomorrow morning , Mrs Villiers &apos; report would not be fair enough .
I agree , but if you had taken account of the order on the list rather than to have voted on the Cashman report first , because there are not many Members here tonight - because that is the reason - we could have voted on the Smet report .
Mr Mann , I will , of course , pass on your first comment to the Bureau and the Conference of Presidents .
the Commission and the Council of the European Union have a serious responsibility to the extent to which the mad cow crisis has taken place in connection with mad cow disease .
as far as the substance of the matter is concerned , my group has proposed the strictest measures to combat the disease .
furthermore , given the unclear wording of paragraph 4 , we need to ask ourselves how serious the authorities really are to fight against all means of fraud and deception , whereas it would be much easier to say in a line that the manufacture and use of meat @-@ and @-@ bone meal would be completely prohibited .
the CAP must raise public health as its primary priority .
the BSE cases in France , like dioxin chickens in Belgium , are the last links in a long chain of thoughtlessness .
the WTO negotiations must be resumed as a matter of urgency , so as to enable European farmers to increase their production of protein @-@ based origin .
the Commission clearly has nothing more than half measures which , in the name of the principle of subsidiarity , should guide the Member States back the necessary freedom of action they need in their countries , their political will , the value of the disease to protect their populations and their society effectively to protect their populations and ensure their safety .
it is from these very legitimate concerns that Parliament felt it was necessary to be particularly vigilant and to make amendments strictly to regulate all issues related to the process of incineration and co @-@ incineration .
all these measures reflect a rethink on the part of the public on waste management issues .
the new forms of exclusion , such as exclusion from the knowledge @-@ based society , are taken into account ,
I can only welcome this initiative , which is in line with the expectations of our fellow European citizens .
this will be achieved through the setting @-@ up of specific objectives to be incorporated into national action plans and the implementation of a policy of equal opportunities .
despite strong economic growth and the lack of unemployment , it is not possible to work out of exclusion today .
the British Labour Government is the leader in the fight against poverty and social exclusion .
there are billions of billions in favour of small @-@ scale subsidies which flout the landscape with their wind @-@ fees .
the Member States must now take this path , in order to respect the environmental objectives that they have set themselves both at European and international level and in order to guarantee their energy autonomy and security of supply .
the importance of nuclear power is constantly growing .
nuclear power may cause disasters to make large parts of the world uninhabitable and produce a dangerous waste product .
the interparliamentary dialogue between Western Europe and East Asia ( ASEP ) must be brought to life as a matter of urgency .
we believe that regional integration is crucial to the three fundamental objectives I have mentioned .
I believe that four years ago - Mr Salafranca is perhaps better reminded of this - a meeting was called into an anti @-@ society , a beautiful city in Guatemala , a beautiful city in Guatemala , and we discussed the future with our counterparts on the future , not only the future of Dayton , but also the European Parliament .
that is why I believe that we must , in my opinion , strongly oppose the critics who would like to call the central American parliament to be an artificial system or empty , devoid of content .
in this context , the Commission and the three levels have a number of projects .
B5 @-@ 08@@ 49 / 2000 by Rod and Maes , on behalf of the Verts / ALE Group ;
that is precisely the meaning of our resolution .
furthermore , lasting peace in the country is inconceivable without religious or ethnic tolerance .
above all , however , we should insist on insisting that this racist Constitution be suspended .
he too has drawn the nationalist card .
we can only ensure that this will be free and peaceful , and we hope that the new government of Côte d &apos;Ivoire has the broad democratic basis necessary to restore ethnic harmony and help this country out of the economic deadlock .
for the same reason , all the blame game is tolerated at the head of the Ivorian State at the head of the Ivorian State , which only protects French interests .
human rights
the number of political prisoners has recently risen from 1500 to 3 000 , many of whom have to work hard and suffer cruel torture .
the problem is , of course , what we , as the European Union , must do now .
Mr President , for many years I have had a poster in my office with a wall that Aung San Suu Kyi shows in the award of the Sakharov Prize by the European Parliament .
many of them have been imprisoned or are harassed and tried to close their offices in Burma .
after all , the West has played a particular role in this .
the European Union should , therefore , at last adopt a firm stance on Vietnam and put the question of the rule of law and not just those of human rights , where some improvements have been made .
I would like to ask for sensitivity to this matter , and I hope that you will forgive me of this abuse of speaking time on Vietnam .
the war between these two countries has not led to lasting bitterness .
President Clinton would do well to raise this issue in Hanoi during these days .
since then , Vietnam has embarked on a foreign policy of the open doors through which the country has its place in the area of our international relations .
we know what it is all about .
of course , this is weak comfort for those who have run dirty water into houses and who have suffered enormous financial losses .
that is certainly true .
it is not fair that people should experience tragedies of this magnitude and see in a very uncertain future , if climate change , which is already apparent , is seen to be absolute certainty that the problems they have experienced in recent weeks will be repeated - if not next year , then in the next or after the year or the year .
consequently , these industries must make the greatest efforts to reduce emissions .
thank you , Commissioner .
and now , with the involvement of 171 Members , as has just been said , we are supposed to vote on such an important text .
I take note of your comments and I can assure you that they will be recorded in the Minutes .
the EU attaches greater importance to the principle of free movement of services than to the right to health and care and to systematically and systematically undermining public health services , in particular , in the field of healthcare , and promoting private forms of protection as the &apos; necessary &apos; supplement or replacement for the public health care system .
despite correct recitals concerning the achievements of the existing systems , which are intended to provide each citizen with a high level of protection of personal income and individual risks , and the reference to the risks of public and private systems and the increasing share of the costs of overall expenditure and the resultant inequalities , all the concrete proposals put forward by the resolution are only encouragement to accelerated Community development of private insurance schemes .
everyone is forced to stand up for solidarity and to look after all sorts of unnecessary money .
own resources of credit institutions ( continuation )
that is the only way to create a level playing field .
it is rather surprising that it was presented at all and that it came to this new initiative by the Commission .
we say yes to a stronger orientation of the equity capital management of credit risks at the level of the economic risk and to the further development of own resources .
Mr President , first of all , I would like to say that the Commission is pleased to note that Mrs Villiers &apos; s report does not only affect the assessment of the directive on own resources , but also the current review of the changes to capital adequacy rules .
we need to support these objectives through sensible rules that are reliable and guarantee the safety of our markets and our financial institutions .
the debate is closed .
as we in this Parliament have to deal with full amendments to the rules on the exercise of the duties of the European Ombudsman , which are currently being discussed in the Committee on Constitutional Affairs , of which I too was appointed rapporteur , and where the Ombudsman &apos;s powers of investigation are concerned , we reserve a qualitative and complete revision of the wording of the relevant regulations .
the Ombudsman &apos;s office certainly helps to remove this democratic deficit .
the debate is closed .
I should like , in particular , to express their views as follows .
Mr President , Mr Bösch has presented an excellent report , and I should like to thank him and Mrs Hautala for the Committee on Legal Affairs .
the rapporteur of the Committee on Petitions of the European Parliament , Mr Bösch , states in the explanatory statement to his report that the principles that led to the recommendations of the Ombudsman coincide with the principles pursued by the European Parliament , namely correctness , transparency and the desire to trust .
the initiative and the Ombudsman &apos;s recommendations are therefore very welcome , as are the Commission &apos;s decision to implement them .
we were able to invite everyone before the Ombudsman &apos;s committee , and the procedure I would like to discuss in a moment could also be of interest to us .
unlike the Member States , which can look back on a long past , the European Union has a short history , so it needs to raise expectations of something new .
in conclusion , I would like to say that , of course , the Commission can only commit itself to itself .
approval of the Minutes of the previous sitting
one way of winning votes is through the resignation and your opponents .
I voted in favour of Mrs Villiers &apos; report on the own resources of credit institutions because it was necessary to update and supplement the existing 11 years of Directive 89 / 299 ( EEC ) .
we support the call for a solution to the conflict between the US and the EU as a result of the discriminatory grams of low @-@ risk management legislation .
I would like to thank the Bavarian and German Interior Ministers , including the former Austrian Minister of the Interior , who made this possible at Tampere together .
the priority must , of course , also be given to the states with which the European Union is opening accession negotiations .
after 110 days of detention , a person who does not have the trial must be released , and must never again be brought to justice for the same crime .
I take one point , and Mr Posselt writes : conducting courses for national police forces on the basis of common standards .
Mrs Karamanou has just voted to reaffirm that the European Parliament is to be consulted , and only the day before yesterday the Group of the Party of European Socialists voted against this resolution because they believe that the members of the European Parliament belonging to the Management Board should be entitled to vote .
no @-@ one in Britain would have thought , at the time , that everything would end up ending the Ode to Joy on the Ode to Joy , as well as its head down in the cement with regard to the European approach to policing .
Parliament can be proud that the proposal to set up this College was born here , and we are grateful to the Portuguese Presidency for having taken up it , and thank the Commission and the Council for their support .
in one country , the police reacted to one and the same situation very differently from the police in another country .
I should like to stress , above all , that for those who have always championed the concept of the local police , as is the case in the United Kingdom , it is gratifying that this concept of British origin is increasingly being supported by a number of countries in the &apos; European mainland &apos; .
as Members of the European Parliament we are very often affected by crime .
administration will also be flexible and dynamic , and the different training courses can be the most suitable national institution .
I have been dealing with these problems for over six years and I have seen several important successes with regard to the return of children who have been abducted , thanks to the support and the resources of the European Parliament .
unfortunately , however , the scope of this regulation is limited and does not extend to families with extra @-@ sex families , who are being defrauded from their rights , recognised and applied to the Community .
this remains a task for the future .
however , I have even more objections to make use of legal weaknesses and a precedent for the setting @-@ up of a social problem in the long term .
Mr President , I have no doubt for Commissioner Vitorino &apos;s commitment to this matter .
the Commission assumes that the Treaty currently in force on the European Community makes it possible to take account of the specific nature of sport in general and its social function .
I recognise that they are committed to this and that , of course , sport , and football in particular , are big business and we cannot expect them to be exempt from the normal rules of business .
the European Parliament has repeatedly expressed its concerns about doping and has repeatedly called for measures to be taken on it .
that concludes this item .
this proposal is particularly harsh and annoying for Ireland .
today we should first remind ourselves that the UK is fully aware of the fact that it has to consult the European Union and that there is a piece of EU legislation to which it should adhere .
I very much hope that this will be a result .
I have just listened to Mr McCartin , who apparently seems to be wrong .
the domestic transport company in Denmark or the United Kingdom receives 365 days a year of full value for money , not so much of the foreign hauliers who come from another Member State and go to the country - perhaps for one or two or a hundred days &apos; time .
unfortunately , with the unfortunate assassination of Ernest Ernest , a new message of violence has been sent to our democracies .
as you know , we have a very wide agenda and , therefore , because of the powers that give me the Rules of Procedure to ensure the proper running of meetings of the sittings , I have taken that decision .
after intensive negotiations both at a sectoral level and at ministerial level , it is not possible , on account of the 500 points that were unable to reach agreement on the draft resolutions , to reach a comprehensive agreement on the main political issues .
however , in the end , the concessions made by other parties on the supplementary principle , joint implementation and the Kyoto mechanisms were not to compensate for the reduction of the emission rights targets , which would have resulted from the adoption of the proposals on &apos; sinks &apos; .
it was inevitable , as was the sinking of the Titanic .
we know CO2 emissions , as we know , and we have discussed it too often enough .
Madam President , the International Conference on Climate Change has failed , but some progress has been made .
fortunately , 14 of the 15 Environment Ministers were united .
this second EU position did not go through , therefore , because the Green Ministers of the European People &apos;s Party ( Christian Democrats ) and European Democrats were not prepared to ignore the French and German ones .
this protocol must not be watered down under any circumstances .
if agreement can be reached with the United States on a lower percentage for the commitments to be met in the country , this is still better than no agreement at all .
nevertheless , I would like to finish on an optimistic note .
we have always pointed out that no agreement is better than a bad one , but it does not yet say that we should make our political wish list as the yardstick of a substance @-@ by @-@ case agreement .
Madam President , ladies and gentlemen , I should like first of all , as chairman of the European Parliament delegation to COP 6 , to express my delight at the excellent relationship the Commission and Parliament have achieved this week .
we must now realise that we cannot fail again .
we have embarked on talks in the areas that we have already described as loopholes or possible loopholes .
we warmly welcome Minister Hubert Védrine .
the work has progressed well with regard to qualified majority voting , and , thanks to the efforts made by certain Member States , it is possible to move on to a qualified majority in some thirty points .
there is a tendency - I say this with reservations - because several Member States have probably not yet set their final opinion on it - there is a trend towards simple re @-@ weighting , the scope of which , of course , details still need to be laid down .
for this reason , the Council could possibly take a Sunday when this should be essential .
the Nice meeting will serve the exchange of views with all the candidate countries on the institutional reform of the Union and , in general , on the future prospects of Europe .
in this context , the French Presidency has made the adoption of the Social Agenda a priority of its priorities .
for the European Council , a declaration is also being prepared on the economic , social and cultural specificities of sport and its social function in Europe .
( applause ) The Member States are clearly finding it difficult , in areas that are as sensitive as social , asylum and immigration policy , to abandon their right of veto on trade policy , a policy of cohesion and tax , even though it is only the technical changes required for the functioning of the internal market .
we also think that , on issues where we do not yet have to come to majority decision , we could establish in the Treaty that we can move through a unanimous decision to majority voting by a unanimous decision , because if you write this in the Treaties , you do not need a revision of the Treaties every time with a long ratification process .
furthermore , we are of the opinion that progress must not only be achieved in terms of qualified majority voting , but that codecision is always necessary in legislative matters .
Mr President @-@ in @-@ Office of the Council , I would like to ask you to present to Parliament a document that is worthy of Parliament &apos;s approval and which will live up to the historic task we face in Europe .
and I say to you , if it comes to feeble compromises or if the yardstick is too low , then we will not deal with it at all , but we will do this for Europe and with a clear conscience .
that would indeed be a very important statement by Parliament , and we can vote on it tomorrow .
it is likely that further steps will be taken last night , which our national parliaments have not discussed clearly and which they will then ratify in the name of an inevitable compromise .
the Treaty of Amsterdam still contains 65 provisions requiring unanimity .
in a democracy , it is the other way around .
likewise , there would be no response to the problem of European Union decision @-@ making power which is still too high .
everyone or nearly all of the previous speakers have stated here that we wish to see a reference to the Charter in Article 6 ( 2 ) , so that we do not underestimate Parliament &apos;s determination to achieve this .
its voice would be stronger , and the voice of the ministers defending agriculture in the service of sustainable development would be much stronger if they could be based on decisions taken here in the codecision procedure .
Mr President , I was part of the active Danish resistance to the Maastricht Treaty of 1992 .
Mr President , Mr President @-@ in @-@ Office of the Council , Mr President of the Commission , in a conversation in this House today , the Latvian President @-@ in @-@ Office said : &apos; we are doing our homework !
I should like to make it clear that the people are being represented in the European Parliament , and that must be expressed in the European Parliament .
Mr President , even in Paris we are divided on Nice .
the Charter of Fundamental Rights must not remain clearly a status in a vacuum .
there is no need to discuss the fact that a number of 700 Members of the European Parliament will no longer be able to apply to a Union of 27 or 28 countries , or the smaller countries will suffer unfair disadvantage .
Mr President , Mr President @-@ in @-@ Office of the Council , Mr President of the Commission , immediately after Nice , the European Parliament is proposing an answer to two historic questions both for the future of the European Union and for its own political credibility .
this is , of course , important , and I am surprised that no @-@ one has mentioned it so far , because we in the committee have dealt with this issue in detail .
we know from the speech made by President Chirac here in July at least three major issues : the simplification of the Treaties and the division of the Treaties between European , national and regional , what I would call the &apos; No 10 of the USA &apos;s Constitution ) , and thirdly , the balance between the institutions , and , above all , the role of the national parliaments should be considered in terms of the role of the national parliaments , in other words , the role of the national parliaments , in other words , the role of our institution in future .
we do not need to be afraid of this .
we all agree that there is a lot of problems with regard to extending qualified majority voting without taking any steps towards its expansion .
the life of Luxembourg &apos;s life is an example of the courage shown by the people of Central and Eastern Europe in spite of all the odds .
as Mrs Berès said , it goes without saying that on the one hand we have the right of codecision on the side of consumer matters , but on the other , on issues relating to agriculture , only opinions can be given .
when we hear Mr Bonde , the Balkans states that for him , the end is the end .
of course , this time it is paradoxically the emerging consensus , which causes many of us political headaches .
we believe this by Forza Italia and by the Group of the European People &apos;s Party ( Christian Democrats ) and European Democrats , and we will be working together with you on the front line when it comes to shaping the citizens of Europe .
now that agreement has been reached on a text which is , moreover , a good text which was very well prepared by the Convention , which is a good reading , some countries say that it should be mentioned in Article 6 .
because , when we developed the idea that the Commission should not in future be too large in order to remain effective and retain its capabilities , in particular its initiative @-@ initiative capacity , we have shown that we were also ready for victims .
once again , I thank you ; we will find this solution together .
the debate is closed .
Mr President , I would be grateful if you would tell Parliament about what has been done about the points that I have raised .
Mr President , I did not know about this incident .
I can tell you that Mrs Fontaine - that has been communicated to me on behalf of the Presidency - deeply regrets this serious incident .
Mr President , a serious incident occurred yesterday in Italy .
this year , this year , with the second human rights forum , this initiative was maintained which will be held in Paris on 12 and 13 December , in other words during the European Parliament &apos;s sittings in Strasbourg .
Mr Gorostiaga , I have to cut you off .
we also agree that the order of precedence is right .
this is not often the case , Mr Defence , and of course we are pleased about this .
I should like to say to the representative of the Council that the European Parliament is willing to acquire this security and defence culture with which we are not yet so familiar , and we would also like the Nice Summit to be a full success .
the institutional aspects are also very important , because they will make it possible for the Union to plan , to decide and to act , in other words to ensure political control and the strategic leadership of the crisis management operation .
as indicated by Mr Brok in his report , the Council will have over @-@ board documents listed between the Union and the individual partner countries in order to make better use of the Union &apos;s overall effort to improve its efficiency and to better prepare its debates on foreign policy measures .
against this background , the recent summit in Zagreb was very significant .
the presidency has endeavoured to develop the Union &apos;s relations with the other major regional blocs , in particular through a series of Asian summits , such as the Third ASEM Summit , the summit with Japan and China .
I should like to be able to say that the pressure we are exerting on our actions to deal with the present situation is , unfortunately , somewhat weak and autonomous towards all these measures .
this is , on the one hand , the catalogue of capacities , a document of 300 pages in which the capacities of our Union for the implementation of all Petersberg tasks as necessary are identified .
a new impetus has therefore been created on the basis of the political will of our Member States , but it will only be credible if it is long term .
perhaps I should begin by responding to the words of my honourable friend John Hume .
as the ministers have already stated in their excellent speeches , there have been significant developments in Europe &apos;s efforts to do something for their own security in recent weeks .
our task is now to continue with this strategy and to ensure that it is successful , and that through the prospect of closer relations with the European family , we will be able to make the economic and political adjustments and reforms necessary in order to safeguard their stability and prosperity .
with regard to aid , the Commission has this year , in particular , via its humanitarian aid ECHO , launched a series of specific measures to alleviate the effects of the catastrophic drought , providing funds for food safety and the slaughter of people displaced by the fighting in the north @-@ east of the country .
what we now need to do is to forge an efficient , effective European unity , headed by a clearly defined leadership .
( DE ) Mr President @-@ in @-@ Office of the Council , when issues are dealt with at European level , it often takes a long time to see visible results .
this means that , for us as parliamentarians , there must be structures in which we can obtain information about decisions so that we have a debate , taking part and putting them to account .
the first - which has already been mentioned by several fellow Members - is the role of the European Parliament .
I can say that the Palestinian expectations of Europe are impressive .
this is also evident from the attitude of an association of solar data , which stresses the fact that we have not recouped our children from Lebanon so that they die for the settlements .
the Middle East conflict could therefore be a test for the effectiveness of European Middle East policy .
( DE ) Mr President @-@ in @-@ Office of the Council , I would particularly like to thank you for the fact that you were in committee and that you were there today .
then the other EU Member States could focus on traditional peacekeeping .
it can only regain its credibility if , as the supreme principle , it has the civilian approach in terms of an effective policy of prevention with available instruments and also equipping them with credibility .
your ultra @-@ ESDP is directed against this enemy .
secondly , NATO has gradually been dissolved and has not been extended to the east .
I cannot tell you how much I am pleased about the discovery that Mr Brok was a dangerous revolutionary right all the time !
we are now engaged in a way in which we can strengthen the conditions for freedom and peace in Europe .
I think that if we bear this right , many concerns could indeed be dispelled .
democratic control of this whole process must be ensured .
I share the view of my Fine Gael colleague , Mrs Doyle , that this is not the creation of a European army and , before appealing to Irish participation in my own country - which will certainly be the case - I would like to make it clear that participation is voluntary and is being examined on a case @-@ by @-@ case basis .
at the time , all political and diplomatic resources , the economic pressures of violence in the middle of Europe and an unacceptable threat to all European values were prevented .
furthermore , I would like to say that , within the framework of all the Council &apos;s positions , there is no budgetary obligation on the part of the European Union to finance any military activity .
A5 @-@ 0326 / 2000 by Mr Harbour , on behalf of the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market , on the reform of the Commission - The Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market ( COM ( 2000 ) 200 - C5 @-@ 0446 / 2000 - 2000 / 22@@ 16 ( COS ) &#93;
that is why we attach importance to the fact that the reform should not be made up from above , but that all employees should be effectively involved in this modernisation effort .
the annual assessment of the development of the operation and the additional costs of this reform requires a vote at the beginning of each financial year .
furthermore , it is totally illogical that only the Council can amend the Financial Regulation , and we repeat our mediation proposal on this point .
we also agreed that a good deal of the shortcomings and irregularities which occurred during the discharge for 1996 was due to the fact that previous Commissions failed to modernise their management and control systems and to apply the rules in force fully .
evidence of this weakness is the extremely limited number of refusals of approval , from permits arrived at by the Commission .
as it is interesting in these discussions , the employment and business practices of the private and public sectors are , in fact , close to each other .
the bottom line is leadership .
it is also time to think about the external representation of the Union .
that is why we are asking the Commissioner : can the Commission really guarantee a transitional period of time ?
I am pleased that the Commission proposal is in line with the position we are going to adopt tomorrow .
the heads of services and institutions must have some form of manoeuvre in the administration .
we still have some catching up to do in this area , and we are hoping for more transparency in the Commission .
on behalf of the PPE @-@ DE Group . - ( ES ) Mr President , in its letter to the Romans it calls for his readers to change and rebuild their way of thinking , to see what the will of God is .
Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , the possible reform of the Commission will continue the road to new European institutions : these institutions will be renewed and modified on account of the problems encountered in the past administration and on the basis of the long , coherent and complex report of the independent experts .
as you will have expected , we support the Group of the Party of European Socialists &apos; Amendments Nos 1 to 6 , but we shall be Amendment No No
Mr Lamassoure &apos;s point on enlargement is that , as regards the accession process , the Commission is waiting for a comprehensive strategy that reflects the interests of the Union in its political calendar and is not merely an assessment of the suitability of the individual candidate countries .
in this way , we urge the Commission and Mr Kinnock to continue with the reform effort .
Mr President , the resignation of the European Commission in the spring of 1999 revealed a much deeper problem in the Commission , which were clearly defined structures in employment , which led to a lack of political accountability , the fragmentation of political priorities and inadequate results .
this cannot be achieved by insisting on the word &apos; internal &apos; in the reforms .
foreign policy is an important and interesting thing for the European Parliament , and as far as I am interested in all my own life , this is a valid explanation .
people who will be reported wrong should act quickly , seriously and effectively .
I am convinced that Parliament will give you another opportunity to expand on this , as this reform will not be completed by the first vote tomorrow .
so , once again , transparency is the objective , and I believe that we are achieving this objective .
it is sometimes forgotten that we are also in a democratic system and that co @-@ determination rules will apply , and that is a good thing .
the Commission , albeit in slightly amended form , maintains a division between political responsibility and executive power , which we regard as little practical experience from past experience .
Mr President , I would like to conclude by saying that we will adopt two amendments and not three others , as the committee has already discussed .
Mrs Sauquillo has taken a really excellent initiative with her report , which will include the area of external relations in this internal reform process , thereby setting the subject on the agenda .
poverty and misery are not only the result of economic backwardness and development problems ; they are often the result of aggression and the exploitation of the weak by the strong , the self @-@ addicted behaviour of them and the weakness of the marginalised .
finally , it should be clear to us that Mr Patten &apos; s proposal to entrust the Commission ’ s services to Mr Nielson , the Director of the Commission , is a remote opt @-@ out from the management lines and is totally incompatible with the Commission &apos;s College structure .
our committee shares the rapporteur &apos;s view that it is up to the Commissioner for Development that the policy in this area be formulated and observed at the same time , even if it is to be coordinated with the other aspects of foreign policy .
here too , the understanding of the budgetary authority has played a crucial role in financing this extensive restructuring of the European external service .
( the sitting was closed at 10.30 a.m. )
some people , especially in France , think that forceful national measures should be taken to protect the French coasts , and some even propose the establishment of French coastguards .
( DE ) Madam President , there can be no doubt that the Commission , like the French Presidency , is taking the issue of maritime safety and environmental protection very seriously .
I would like to conclude by thanking Mr Gayssot , the President @-@ in @-@ Office of the Transport Council , for his encouraging words .
we all agree on that , but we must find the methodology by which this particular priority can be implemented in practice , and we still have to conclude an agreement between the three institutions .
on many points , as Mr Watts has already explained , the European Parliament has a stronger position than it seems to be in the Council .
discussions have continued with the sectors concerned and there has been a great deal of contact with the French Presidency with the aim of reaching a consensus text that can be adopted quickly by the two legislative bodies , the Council and the European Parliament .
despite the fact that there are still industrial and radioactive discharges from various sources , this is generally seen as unacceptable in general terms without regard to the future .
moreover , the public has a right to know what preparatory measures have been carried out , what type of material the threat is and what the consequences are .
I am convinced that this must lead to the creation of a European coastguard service in the long term .
I shall be supporting this report and the Commission &apos;s amendments , but I would urge Members to support the amendments of the Committee on the Environment , Public Health and Consumer Policy as regards social standards .
it is less gratifying , as has just been pointed out , that , in the past , the States of the European Union have not covered themselves with glory in terms of maritime safety .
help the Commission to send out a clear signal here .
anyone working in this sector bears no insignificant responsibility .
Mr President , Commissioner , Mr President @-@ in @-@ Office of the Council , the disasters of recent months have revealed the shortcomings in the legislation and the shortcomings in the control systems , as well as in terms of human and financial resources .
a few weeks ago , on the west coast of France , a few weeks ago there was a new ecological disaster on the coast of France , and only today is the European Parliament &apos;s intention to express its opinion on the reinforcement of maritime safety .
the rapporteur quite rightly points out that the condition of the oil tanker is more valuable than its age .
Mr President , I shall confine myself to commenting on the majority opinion of the Socialist Group on that one of the proposals that the directive on standards for the inspectors will be amended .
we do not want them in our ports or in our waters .
I am taking up two dossiers : port State control and the phasing @-@ out of single @-@ hull tankers .
if we want to be credible , we need to act quickly and put an end to our political speeches .
everyone is now familiar with the attitudes of the others , and this is another reason why we need the vote today .
there is still much to be done , however , for improving safety at sea .
the judiciary is implacable against poor people who are not able to pay any levies or fines , except for the attachment of their modest belongings .
I therefore think that there is still an enormous amount left to do in this area .
that is why it is important to reaffirm a fundamental political and cultural imperative : it is time to put an end to the emergency aid culture and instead to enforce the culture of prevention .
the problem of safety of this mode of transport can only be solved with a careful punishment of those responsible , with the cost of which the sector has to pay the world , so that we do not penalise the European industry any more .
we should always remember that double @-@ hull or double @-@ skilled do not provide an absolute guarantee that there will be no more accidents in the future .
I would like to say to Mr Jarzembowski that the Council is not seeking compromise .
Madam President , first of all I would like to thank you all for this interesting and valuable debate .
amendments Nos 1 , 6 , 7 and 8 also refer to the refusal of access .
in order to achieve the main objective of this proposal , namely to phase out the old single @-@ hull tankers quickly , we are prepared to agree to the deletion of the proposed system of incentives , which provides for different port and pilotage charges .
the Member States need to be sure that the classification society they select are carrying out their full satisfaction .
this leaves Amendment No 10 which deals with the important issue of the restrictions on liability .
let me conclude by pointing out that , a month ago , the Ievoli Sun sank with 6 000 tonnes of dangerous freight off the road .
&quot; It is clear that there can be an incompetent and provocative civil servant , but if 15 Member States agree , then , Madam President , you must take the initiative , Madam President , and urge the Council to respect a prerogative of the Members of the European Parliament .
report ( A5 @-@ 0342 / 2000 ) by Mr Ortuondo Larrea , on behalf of the Committee on Regional Policy , Transport and Tourism , on the proposal for a European Parliament and Council Directive amending Council 94 / 57 / EC on common rules and standards for ship inspection and survey organisations ( COM ( 2000 ) fruits ) - C5 @-@ 0175 / 2000 - 2000 / 0066 ( COD ) &#93;
amendment No 2 :
( Parliament adopted the resolution )
the creation of employment must remain one of our top priorities .
at the same time , vessel owners , with the help of flags of convenience , are still uncontrolled , making international shipping in an even worse situation .
the European Commission &apos;s proposal seems to be reassuring , but is well aware of it , as it did not seem to have been .
to this end , we must ensure that the measures we are proposing today are applied by all the Member States of the European Union .
the Commission is right to prevent Europe lagging behind the US .
many experts are now pointing out the difficulties with the review and maintenance of the area between the two pieces of packaging .
this is an important decision , but it is not enough .
I have also voted in favour of all the amendments which improve and tighten up the Commission proposal .
the revision of Directive 94 / 57 / EC is all the more urgent when Malta and Cyprus , who have the world &apos;s four @-@ thirds or sixth largest fleets , are candidates for accession .
port money is saved by going on in the back of a storm and , by taking the risk of accidents at other times too , with fatal accidents .
safety at sea must not be classified as an urgent matter after every new disaster that affects our coasts , but must be the subject of an integrated and permanent international policy .
it is also quite irrelevant to us whether the Charter of Fundamental Rights will be incorporated into the Treaty or not , because the so @-@ called Charter of Fundamental Rights is already left open not only to the basic rights of the workers but also to the possibility of social regression .
I consider this to be a crucial criterion in the assessment of the Treaty of Nice .
on the eve of the Nice Summit , I would like to pay tribute to the remarkable work done by the French Presidency and the overwhelming number of ministers who have not spared every effort to meet regularly with Parliament both at committee meetings and in plenary .
the debate and the resolution adopted by the European Parliament give rise to serious concerns about what will be decided at the Nice Summit , particularly as regards possible restrictions on the sovereignty of small countries such as Portugal , the strengthening of federalism and the militaristic approaches in terms of security and defence policy , as well as the weak and clearly inadequate measures in the social field .
for Treaty reform and , therefore , for enlargement to be a success , it needs the full support of the people .
Mr Harbour &apos;s proposals for the White Paper on the White Paper are reforms that correspond to common sense .
for the voters I represent here do not agree with any of the lines in question .
it is becoming increasingly clear that the debate on proportionality ( votes in the Council and seats in the Council ) has opened a Pandora &apos;s box of power between Member States , a Pandora &apos;s box which will be difficult to conclude in Nice .
therefore , if you manage to prevent wars , as you have done so far , you will do what is ever done in the world .
the delegation from the Group of Independents for a Europe of Nations Group voted resolutely against Mr Brok &apos;s own @-@ initiative report by the Committee on Foreign Affairs .
I have one in my name - it is the son of my sister - trained in the NATO bases of the United States to hunt pilots &apos; pilots &apos; ; he made the test and can now enter the air force as a pilot .
each Member State must decide for itself whether it wants to participate in a common European defence and security policy .
we are convinced that a Europe of peace will not be created through military alliances .
we do not need a Euro @-@ militarism .
I appreciate the attempt to develop a common European security policy , but I am opposed to the creation of a common military defence .
we do not believe that armament , and the increased military spending , are the right response to the European challenges of these years .
we have 19 recitals and 23 paragraphs with 36 undertones .
however , the document goes further in its own language .
the issues raised in the report can be resolved by means of a humane asylum and refugee policy , with the help of organising a balance between work and leisure , and through solidarity , social acceptance of responsibility for people with special needs .
the rapporteur believes that there is a need for a legal framework at European level that enables the victims of budgetary services to enjoy legal protection .
it wants this work to be recognised as a full occupation and requires the creation of European legislation on the rights of these workers at present the situation varies from one country to another .
Guy @-@ Quint report ( A5 @-@ 0327 / 2000 )
there is also a need to remove nepotism and obscure conditions in the Commission ’ s services , especially as regards recruitment of staff for fixed @-@ term contracts .
that is why we must be careful to ensure that these commitments are applied much better than in the past .
I voted in favour of the Lamassoure report , which mainly concerns the institutional aspects of the reform of the Commission .
I regret that , and that is why , as a group , we abstained from the vote because , as far as we are concerned , NGOs find themselves badly away .
( applause )
so , do you not want a resolution ?
Madam President , no one underestimates the importance and significance of this summit , which was one of the longest in the history of the European Union .
Madam President , it has been mentioned what the task of the Committee on Constitutional Affairs could be .
thank you very much , Mr Hänsch , for your constructive contribution .
in the light of this decision , and the fact that Mr Liikanen will not be here on Thursday but later on Wednesday , I would like to ask whether it would be possible to transfer the Gill report on European digital content from Thursday to Wednesday to close this gap .
Madam President , since 20 October to date , there have been 200 political prisoners in Turkey who are in a fatal hunger strike to protest against the policy of the Turkish Government , which wants to break the morale and resistance of prisoners with the &apos; white &apos; breast cells .
Madam President , this is the second time we are discussing this directive this year , and again many amendments have been tabled .
in spite of this clear line , we must realise that we are in Parliament to respect the principles of the rule of law and , as a consequence , we need to recognise the limits of our powers , we need to see how far the responsibility lies with Article 95 , the legal basis provided for the new tobacco directive .
finally , in order to preserve this fundamental principle , we have also proposed an extension of the legal basis to Article 133 of the Treaty , in particular a postponement of the deadline of which the Member States must be applied to 1 January 2007 .
let us be absolutely sure that they know when they decide for one or another .
we take the view , however , that there are significant differences between tobacco advertising and this directive .
the Court of Justice has just lifted the 1998 directive banning advertising and sponsorship for tobacco products .
however , I do not agree with the suggestion made by the Council concerning the size of the warnings on packaging of other tobacco products as cigarettes , which proposes Amendment No 25 , since the limit of 50 cm of the surface area of a cigarette packet is too close .
that is what this problem is all about .
therefore , with the current Article 95 , ex @-@ article 100 A , they have a correct legal basis .
I am also afraid that this may serve as a bad example if , at a later date , warnings are to be issued to other products .
Mr President , it is appropriate that we have a moral obligation to inform the 30 million consumers in the European Union as a whole on the health risks of cigarettes .
instead of cigarettes , we are going to export jobs - 4 000 in my region .
Mr President , first of all I would like to congratulate Mr Maaten on an excellent report .
Mr President , smoking is the most common cause of preventable illness and disease the tragedy of our times .
if you use Article 133 on the export ban , it must be said that it is not up to a common commercial policy to prescribe to third countries what they are supposed to import .
there should be no exceptions for trademarks , otherwise we create new distortions in competition and in the internal market .
I hope the Commissioner can possibly promise to increase staffing levels within the Commission .
Mr Bowis asked about the applicability of the derogation .
98 and 111 on the subject of a directive banning certain types of advertising and sponsorship would have been permitted on the basis of Article 100a of the EC Treaty .
the Commission would prefer to evaluate the available data and to produce a report in due course .
the Commission reports on the application of excise directives address this problem in an appropriate manner .
as rapporteur , I would recommend support for these amendments because they are very useful .
the extra hour of the summer months has a positive impact on tourism and leisure , where there is a direct link between the summer &apos;s summer and an increase in business .
I have said it because my group and I are convinced that Europe has greater problems and challenges .
the amendments tabled by Parliament and the rapporteur are therefore not helpful - in my opinion - because they lead to insecurity rather than greater confidence .
for example , in view of the technical requirements relating to timetabling , particularly in the transport sector , there is a need for continuous , long @-@ term planning , but not just there .
the next item is the report ( A5 @-@ 0349 / 2000 ) by Mr Liese , on behalf of the Committee on the Environment , on the adoption of a Directive of the European Parliament and of the Council on the implementation of good clinical practice in the conduct of clinical trials in the conduct of clinical trials of medicinal products ( 8@@ 78 / 2000 - C5 @-@ mark 24 / 2000 - 1997 / 0197 ( COD ) ) .
with regard to direct benefits , we need to distinguish between clinical trials between the gift of medicinal and monitoring , which are necessary to draw conclusions for future patients .
furthermore , non @-@ informed adults can only be involved in the tests that are linked to their particular illness , which is responsible for their inability to consent .
I would like to say something else about another point that is important for me , namely Amendment No 30 , which deals with non @-@ commercial clinical trials .
in order to achieve this objective , medical science must have all the means available to ensure a high level of personal and public health .
the debate is closed .
it should not be forgotten that the acquis communautaire will essentially be involved in the new health programme under examination , and it makes sense to extend it .
I believe - as Mr Trakatellis said - that we should not deal lightly with the health of the sick who are expected to benefit from our aid , and nor should the NGOs need Community funds to implement public health policies on the ground .
the programmes for the prevention of drug addiction must not be confined just to the subject of fuel , but must be extended to many other regions of the European Union .
to sum up , Madam President , I have to say that I am going too far in the development of public health in the European Union .
status of victim of criminal proceedings
it must be stressed here that despite its importance and despite the fact that it is a cornerstone of Europe , the Convention has still not been ratified by the following European Union Member States ( Austria , Belgium , Greece , Ireland , Italy , Portugal , Portugal and Spain ) .
the second aspect that played a certain part was the issue of video hunting .
it may be that we have devoted too little time to the victims , often the weakest link in this area .
finally , this initiative is also significant because the European Parliament is able to make significant changes to the legislative proposal , as recommended in the excellent report by Mrs Cerdeira and endorsed by the Committee on Citizens &apos; Freedoms and Rights , Justice and Home Affairs .
it is also noted that , when victim of the victim of the victim , there is discrimination .
Mr President , the culprit is identified and judged to have been identified and sentenced , but he has fled the country .
it may be difficult , for example , for a foreign crime victim to pursue legal proceedings and procedures across national borders and , of course , special action is needed in such cases .
the report has been the subject of difficult discussions in the Council .
the Commission would like to continue the feasibility study on such a project .
Mr Posselt , we will present your arguments to the College of Quaestors so that an appropriate decision is taken that will be taken into account by all Members .
the Commission therefore supports the request for urgent procedure from the Council and asks the Members of the European Parliament to support this urgent procedure .
I have been informed by my chairman of the Committee on Budgets that it is the first time that an agreement has been reached between the Council and Parliament in respect of the conciliation .
the Commission has presented its report with analysing the outstanding commitments and its strategic approach to the closure of the worst of cash .
we can finance cooperation with the Baltic region and our rapid reaction capability , and we have allocated MEDA a higher EUR 40 million higher than the Council has planned .
having received so little time available , which I regret , given that the budget also deserves more than a derisory two @-@ and @-@ a @-@ half @-@ minute budget , I must confine myself to a few comments .
Mr President , when a delegation from this Parliament visited the People &apos;s Republic of China a while ago , we visited the People &apos;s Republic of China , in the south @-@ east of China , and saw an island looming on the horizon .
the representatives of the three institutions did not make every effort to reach an overall agreement on the 2001 budget , and I would like to take this opportunity , on behalf of the Council , to thank both the parliamentary delegation and Mrs Schreyer .
I am pleased that our institutions have succeeded in agreeing to approve all the elements of this Letter No 2 in a single reading , which includes not only agricultural expenditure but also the fisheries agreements and the inclusion of the expected balancing of the financial year 2000 in the preliminary draft of the Budget for 2001 .
for my part , I attach a great deal of importance to this .
having said that , I would like to highlight the excellent atmosphere in which this budgetary procedure has expired .
by providing an emergency aid package of EUR 200 million , the Union has also shown that it is capable of acting quickly and fully respecting its external responsibilities .
Mr President , I would like to respond to the question by Mr Colom i Naval on the use of the flexibility instrument in connection with the review of the Financial Perspective .
we have praised Commissioner Busquin , who has surpassed our expectations in this area .
Mr President , as draftsman of the opinion of the Committee on Development and Cooperation , I would like to say firstly that the European Parliament won a happy victory by not making cuts in programmes to combat poverty in Latin America , Asia and Africa .
I refer in particular to Euronews : citizens must have the opportunity to follow what is happening in Parliament and the Union .
the budget is only 1.06 % , and , Mr Colom i Naval , it is in line with the financial perspectives .
I would like to thank Mrs Schreyer , who has also helped us further with very constructive approaches , and , of course , for my good friend , Mrs Haug , who has done an excellent job , as did Joan Colom i Naval and Mr Markus Ferber .
you say the whole time , for you , the Financial Perspective is inviolable .
our group will also vote in favour of this budget , because this budget shows that , despite growing pressure , we have once again reached a compromise .
ladies and gentlemen , we now welcome the President of the French Republic and President @-@ in @-@ Office of the Council , Mr Jacques Chirac .
it is also worthy of the European spirit which finally made it possible to conclude Nice , after the questions that were unresolved in Amsterdam , and which were set out in the future .
I now turn to one of the most positive results of the Intergovernmental Conference .
enlargement is an extremely important task for Europe .
the future will have full implications , and I would like to thank the House , which has made a major contribution to the preparation of its work .
a year ago , the tanker Erika off the French coast fell , despite the very great commitment of volunteers and the authorities , to dealing with the consequences of this disaster .
first , we have completed the process initiated by the Cologne and Helsinki European Councils .
fortunately , on this occasion , the Union has been able to announce that it will provide some EUR 13 billion over seven years , including , of course , loans from the European Investment Bank .
the Commission proposals on safety at sea and the establishment of a European Food Authority have met with broad approval , and this also applies to the decisions taken in favour of our seven outermost regions .
ultimately , it was the weighting of the voting in the Council , which was the most debated and where it was the most difficult to reach a decision .
unfortunately , in the last few months - and this is something we must never repeat because it is a creeping poison in the European Union - we are witnessing the contrast between the big countries and the small countries , and some of them are very sparing @-@ minded countries and some small countries have behaved magnificently .
it is a retrograde step which concerns all areas of Community life , and I predict you , Mr President @-@ in @-@ Office of the European Council , that our fellow citizens - and I fear that we in Parliament and the Heads of Government - will have to go to school once again to learn the arithmetic .
I can say that there are some things we are pleased about and much that is of concern to us .
( applause )
the numerous blockades that have emerged from this summit between the Fifteen are symptomatic .
without support for the people , because there is no European people , States are forced to take up their national interests at all times and change their national interests , changing the number of Members who are already obsolete by the Treaty of Amsterdam , or increasing the number of members of the European Commission to 27 , where the current Commission of the Fifteen does not work .
what is France &apos;s fault of these people , when the European bubble burst and the French remain the bitter recognition once again of mediocre and selfish politicians ?
instead , there are serious problems and concerns and each individual is the result of national will which must not be brushed aside , but must take seriously .
the Presidency has condemned these shortcomings and has had some reservations and has also made considerable efforts to ensure that France is moving forward in the areas it considers to be particularly sensitive .
that is why these amendments , the so @-@ called compromise amendments , are tabled by three political groups .
it was indeed necessary to find a solution to the situation in which Member States have different legal and administrative rules for clinical trials .
indeed , I think it would be appropriate for the same summer time to apply in all the Member States of the European Union . &apos;
let us move on to the explanations of vote on Mrs Cerdeira Morterero &apos;s report .
appropriate measures must be taken to guarantee the victims of crime : the right to information and the preservation of information ; the provision of communication ; participation in procedure and access to free legal aid ; appropriate protection of individuals and privacy , the right to criminal redress and the possibility of settling disputes through arbitration .
European Council / French Presidency ( continuation )
that is why many of us feel desperate about Nice .
at Nice , the Heads of State and Government recognised what we said after Amsterdam , namely that the method of the Intergovernmental Conference is no longer appropriate to advancing Europe from the top .
as a representative of the groups forming part of the European Free Alliance , I would like to warn the Commission , but especially the Council , for the case that the EU does not want to be more than an intergovernmental community .
Mr President , the rather unanimous messages of the President @-@ in @-@ Office of the Council , the Commission and the Heads of State and Government say that the Treaty of Nice creates the framework for the unification of Europe .
in other words , the democratic deficit has grown yet again .
let us give serious thought to what has happened .
in reality , however , the President himself is unrealistic when he thinks that the enlargement of the Union would be possible with such a treaty .
Mr President , the Nice Summit was and should be a historic summit which , for the new Europe of the new century , was the beginning of a united Europe , all Europeans .
enlargement has given you and all of us the same task before the Monnet and Schuman and other fifty years ago : a method , a structure and a vision for the future of Europe .
there is , therefore , only one great satisfaction : enlargement .
there are four main problems .
this clause reflects the position of the European Parliament , according to which the European Union cannot continue to develop itself by means of intergovernmentalism &apos;s current practice .
I am also trying to imagine - as the President of the Republic is here this morning - what would happen if we had arrived here without a Treaty of Nice .
we have tried to achieve a simple priority for this squaring of the circle , and I believe that the overall result is balanced .
we will then work together , together , and look at how things are to go on .
we must abolish the rule of consensus , and this also applies to a future convention .
in all these cases we reached the conclusion that the Treaties were not satisfactory in every respect , that all our hopes were not met , but that they were nonetheless a step forward and , at least , an improvement on the status quo .
the second is the logic of the weighting of votes , which was considered a different approach to the Council than to the European Parliament , and many people are going to look at the Treaty of Nice and ask why that was the case .
however , the Nice European Council , like many other summits in the history of the European Union , is a victory for reality , a victory of pragmatism over @-@ utopia .
we could have given more and better consciences to the people a better and stronger European result .
this summit could have seen complete success if the inevitable revision of the Treaties were crowned with the same success as the areas I have just mentioned .
this form of form is more democratic .
Mr Blair has returned to the United Kingdom as a great hero , because he did not give in to a number of points and fought for his country &apos;s interests .
in the course of today &apos;s debate we have in no way concealed our satisfaction and still less dissatisfaction with the Treaty of Nice , for which sometimes we have been motivated by the same feeling and the same concerns .
a wonderful signal to our next partner in the South !
Mr President , we must admit that our House is poorly staffed , but , unfortunately , the budget debate has taken more time than is provided for , and we , that is to say the speakers and myself , will not have the opportunity to discuss the matter with the Presidency .
Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , the principles of rigour , social and economic balance have been taken into account in budgetary terms .
let us not deceive ourselves : this is a good budget .
at the end of the day , nobody knows whether it will be compulsory to produce and whether it will be compulsory , and it is at stake .
Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , Madam Commissioner , Madam Vice @-@ President of the Council , ladies and gentlemen , in every financial year , the European Parliament is gaining its own budgetary interest .
and I go further because it is not enough to have ambitious and transparent rules for the implementation of the budget , such as the cancellation of commitment appropriations after two years of under @-@ implementation .
we all know that .
this is a splendid piece of praise , which we are giving , and you can be sure that in the future we are trying to control it closely .
now , now , you also have measures that explicitly promote environmental protection .
Mr President , relations with Russia have changed radically following the end of the Cold War .
furthermore , I do not think that Russia &apos;s importance in the budget is true , but we do not agree with the Social Democrats on this point .
I really support all efforts to encourage Russia and Ukraine to follow our path and cooperate with other countries of the alliance in crisis management , but I am somewhat against moving in their direction or changing our policies in order to meet them .
if this situation is not rapidly amended by Russia by creating the necessary legal and security framework , thus creating a friendly investment climate , despite the high oil prices at present , it is hard to find a way out of the critical economic situation .
this means that we have a common responsibility for peace in the Caucasus , for environmental protection in Russia and for the rights of indigenous peoples there .
in my opinion , the solution cannot be military nature : the situation is quite clear .
in the last few days of the well @-@ known Russian opposition politicians , the ancient people of the Western press once more .
creative solutions for the people of the Kaliningrad people in respect of their freedom to future transit travel by Lithuania and Poland should also be ready before Poland and Lithuania &apos;s accession to the EU .
this is not only because each of the major European powers is keen , above all , to defend the interests of their own capitalist corporations , but also because one has to ask : what does the capitalist Europe have to offer Russia ?
the strategy paper presented by Mr Oostlander creates a way forward , for which I thank him .
this report was welcomed by all the Members of this Parliament , with the exception of the people who are full of nostalgia for those who did not recall such golden times as those described by many courageous Soviet dissidents .
in this context , I am much in favour of close cooperation with Sweden , which will shortly be taking up the Presidency in order to make concrete progress with regard to the Northern Dimension .
these issues therefore play such an important role because we take our relations with Russia so seriously .
subject : genetically modified organisms and crops since spring 2000 numerous cases of release genetically modified organisms and crops , such as cotton , winter spirits and maize have been released in various EU countries since spring 2000 .
this common position contains much more stringent rules for the Member States .
if the Council wanted to do that , it would be reckless and unwise .
secondly , has the Council informed itself of the Council of Europe ’ s Human Rights Commissioner , which is , after all , well represented at the spot ?
the President @-@ in @-@ Office of the Council must know whether he has met Mr Maskhadov or not .
what improvements will the Council make to Directive 92 / 12 / EEC , which is referred to here , so that the responsibilities of the supplier and the recipient are clearly defined without the possibility of fraud ?
this report proves , as you have rightly said , that tax fraud in the Community has reached worrying levels .
I should like to point out to the honourable Members that recital 3 of the draft directive clearly states that its implementation does not violate the agreements of the Geneva Convention on Refugees , dated 28 July 1951 , as amended by the &apos; New York protocol of 31 January 1967 &apos; .
the Commission &apos;s recent proposal for a Council regulation amending Regulation ( EC ) No 3@@ 820 / 98 of the Council to extend customs exemption without quantitative restrictions on goods originating in the least developed countries is based on the Commission &apos;s initiatives to improve access to the market for the least developed countries ( LDCs ) .
as this is my last meeting here , I would simply like to make it clear what this procedure consists of .
after all , animals that are more than 30 months old should no longer be allowed to enter the food chain .
as you have pointed out , this is a far @-@ reaching decision that was taken just a short while ago , the last decision I mentioned dates from 4 December and that is just one week ago .
this party , which seeks to reconcile Islam and modernity , and which could make an important contribution to the resurgence of the process of democratisation and thus strengthening the rule of law , is confronted with a ban on the current pretext that it is dangerous to state security .
subject : UN Special Session on Children at the special session of the United Nations General Assembly on Children in September 2001 , the situation of children in the world will be discussed and the possibility of adopting a new action plan to be adopted in order to make children &apos;s rights across the world a reality .
question No 11 by ( H @-@ 08@@ 94 / 00 ) :
the case of court case strikes me : twice Turkey has been condemned .
this applies in particular to the holding of prison in France &apos; s box and lorry drivers from the United Kingdom and other countries .
Article 23 of the Treaty on European Union states that a decision of this kind will be taken unanimously by the Council , as is all the other decisions with regard to defence policy .
question No 22 by ( H @-@ 09@@ 18 / 00 ) :
we know that unfortunately no progress has been made in Nice in this area .
following the changes and democratic developments in Yugoslavia , following the EU &apos;s Stabilisation and Association Agreement with the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia and the Stabilisation and Association Agreement under the auspices of the Republic of Croatia , the prospect of democratisation and normalisation in the Western Balkans is going to be taken into account , and the role that Croatia can play in this is crucial .
the changed attitude of the newly elected Croatian authorities to the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia is also one of the positive results of Croatia .
I would also like to stress that Croatia is committed to putting relations with neighbouring countries in order .
it had not been possible for this country , unlike the neighbouring country of Slovenia , to develop in 1991 , following its independence in 1991 , that it is already a candidate country .
Mr President , it gives me great pleasure to comment on the excellent report by the honourable gentleman , Mr Baltas , who , as several speakers said , has not lost any time in examining the Commission negotiating a Stabilisation and Association Agreement with the Republic of Croatia .
as the House knows , Croatia was host to the Zagreb Summit last month , and Croatia managed this historic event with extremely impressive skill and a great deal of diplomacy .
we welcome Parliament &apos;s support so far , not least on the important issue of the legal basis for the Stabilisation and Association Agreement .
the road to democracy , respect for human rights , responsible governance and case law and the elimination of corruption seem long and fraught with obstacles .
last week , a hundred students were arrested , four of whom were repatriated to their parents .
the EU embassy in Jakarta can take on this task .
Mr President , the positive developments in Indonesia are so evident that there is a need for a new relationship and effective cooperation with that country .
in West Timor there are more than one hundred thousand refugees than real human signs of the moral and physical perpetrators of the crimes committed in East Timor .
in many places , violence prevails rather than dialogue .
the international community must put massive pressure on Jakarta to put an end to the violence on the Moluccas .
I believe that Indonesia is a great country , but it is at a crossroads , and it is dependent on the efforts of the international community and the European Union to decide on the path to democracy , respect for human rights , for the rule of law and , on the contrary , whether chaos develops .
the position that we have to decide on the territorial integrity of Indonesia is quite simple : we only need to comply with international law and United Nations Resolution No 247 4 of the 1969 United Nations .
Mr President , I welcome this report but I think it is rather too optimistic .
the question that remains unresolved as regards West Timor is a special case .
with our support for the Attorney General &apos;s Office in Jakarta , we intend to support its efforts in the fight against corruption .
the enlargement of the Community and the introduction of euro money can bring further risks .
I would like to thank the Commission for its efforts and commitment ...
I am sure , Commissioner , when this first step is being taken , the discussion about the European Public Prosecutor loses the nature of a religious war between opponents and supporters who are blocking progress so far .
despite our sympathy for the rapporteur , Mrs Theato , and her hard work , we are opposed to the creation of an independent European public prosecutor , because it is part of a federal Europe that we reject .
Mr President , it is always a pleasure to speak after Mr Dell &apos;Alba and a British Euro @-@ sceptic sounds very reasonable .
I would like to congratulate Mrs Theato on her report and particularly on her efforts to come here , as I know she does not feel comfortable this evening .
the strategy includes four sets of action : the area of anti @-@ fraud legislation , operational cooperation between the relevant authorities , interinstitutional action to combat fraud in office and further development of the penal dimension .
the next IGC , then , will be the next Intergovernmental Conference .
this has happened on several occasions in the case of the Structural Funds .
we must adhere strictly to our task and , in the discharge procedure , focus exclusively on the budgetary year to be dealt with .
one day , we will have to change this type of Council which is washing its hands and never to blame .
the Court of Auditors presents its reports and one of its main assets is the European Parliament .
to put it bluntly , the main thrust of the report is that , in future , the Committee on Budgetary Control will look more closely and even to name names when it comes to the unfinished stay of European taxpayers &apos; money .
not for the first time , I have seen how the UK Social Affairs Minister said on television that he could save GBP 6 billion if it was possible to stop fraud .
according to the events of last year , your aim is to make the procedure of budgetary control and budgetary discharge more transparent and , above all , more efficient and effective .
that , too , would have to be taken into account .
in my opinion , the common position we have before us today , which we have to decide on today , has a number of crucial shortcomings , which have not been disputed by anyone in the debate so far from the point of view of principle .
if we look at something like that on three pages , it is clear that there are plenty of evidence and cause for dispute and that this will not create legal certainty .
the European internal market is a Europe @-@ wide market , in which the stock market must be treated in the same way as any other market , while national borders must not interfere with the essential equivalence of the rules governing the market if they are separate from different legal systems .
in the second block there are a number of amendments aimed at improving the participation of staff in the event of a takeover bid .
three key elements are being proposed for the moment , since the control of a business is shifting : the protection of minority shareholders , transparency in relation to supply information and the supervision of the supply chain .
clarity on this matter is of the utmost importance and , in this sense , we will also support the critical part of Amendment No
there is a greater understanding of the specific national characteristics , because otherwise , it will have disastrous consequences for the company structure of the individual Member State .
Mr Bolkestein himself has stated that in these cases the shareholders need to be consulted by the management or management of the target company .
Mr President , it is interesting to take the floor as a British representative , and I can assure him that the British economy is not on the ground , even though my party would like to see a change of government .
the purpose of this amendment is to introduce an instrument that allows a majority transaction to take on the other securities .
in this respect , the situation in the United States can be very instructive and should encourage us to be more careful .
I should also like to express particular thanks to the Members of the Progressive Alliance of Agriculture and Mr Echerer , who have contributed to the sound compromises in many of the conversations .
the concerns that have been raised on a number of occasions can be combined into two large groups .
Mr President , from the point of view of inflation , as the representative of the State @-@ of @-@ member states rightly pointed out , the proposal we are discussing has been grossly violated in the course of its examination by the Council .
I will have a lot of persuading to do in my country , but I am firmly convinced that the harmonisation of resale rights , as the EP sees it , will bring benefits for all concerned .
this has nothing to do with national special interests , but with a contribution to open and transparent political debate .
in the case of one of these paintings , it would have been very difficult to find the family of the artist ; only the search services and debt collection representatives would have benefited .
the second important question is the upper limit , which is deleted in Amendment No 7 .
- I take note of your comment , Mrs McNally .
I think that the debate on this important subject , which is very close to the heart of the committee , must be debated today .
what I was a little surprised , as rapporteur , during the debate in recent months is that we lost sight of these three things .
without calling into question the modernization of all postal services and the opening up to competition , the Member States will have to retain their rural network , as a factor for closer proximity to the centres of decision @-@ making centres for the social cohesion of small urban and rural communities .
there is no reason for the citizen being offered not to take on all the technical and economic advances , and I believe that , from this point of view , the abolition of specialist services represents a final step forward .
Madam President , Commissioner , first of all , I would like to thank our colleague , Mr Ferber , once again on behalf of my group , because he has tried and found compromises in committee .
the Commission &apos;s proposal , in the words of Mr President @-@ in @-@ Office of the infamous US astronauts , is &apos; a giant leap for mankind &apos; , as the original margin is to be reduced from 350 g to 50 grams .
I am sorry , Mr Ferber , but I am concerned about the job losses and the consequences that will arise .
a number of my group disagrees with me on a number of points , and I will say something about that in a moment .
it would increase the expectations of our citizens if we were to restore the balance in the area of public services by making any further expansion of the market sphere dependent on compliance with the basic objective of the sustainable development of European society .
private providers are also able to transport mail to four times the tariff registration for a normal letter .
indeed , it only provides us with a minimum further market opening and , on the other hand , leaves us completely in the dark about the next steps , while , for the universal service , Sweden &apos; s example should reassure those who think that privatisation would disappear .
although it is not enough now , by Parliament , to be a step in the right direction , we should certainly ensure that the thread will be resumed in a few years &apos; time .
let me tell you , ladies and gentlemen , that once the post office has hospital , or possibly twice , it is not , of course , the last European social authority .
as rapporteur for our Committee on services of general economic interest , I have no doubt that we need to keep a close eye on these developments .
my Spanish colleagues claim - and I would like to know whether they were right in this - that Spain had implemented the 1997 Directive in full . other countries would have done nothing , and those others who remained inactive have now tried to take huge steps forward .
in our case , for example , a country with an average external share understandably has no problems , while a country is getting bogged down in a hopeless situation , even though cross @-@ border post will be liberalised , in accordance with Mr Bolkestein &apos;s proposal .
we in this House must give the postal market a chance .
( DE ) Madam President , it is not for nothing that the state monopoly of postal services has been introduced in the 19th century .
there has been intensive discussion of the Commission &apos;s proposal to liberalise the postal services everywhere in my constituency , from Mal@@ to the islands and from the suburbs of the suburbs to the islands .
it is precisely from the point of view of the Spanish experience that has already been referred to , that I consider Parliament &apos;s amendments to improve the proposal submitted to us by the Commission , because it is a moderating - indeed an excellent proposal - on the pace of openness and liberalisation .
Madam President , Mrs Laguiller and I oppose any form of the intrusion of private capital into postal services .
Madam President , Commissioner Bolkestein , ladies and gentlemen , today &apos; s debate gives us the impression that we are talking about the Echternach procession : two steps forward .
that is why I have retabled some of the amendments that we discussed in committee and which we will support , particularly with regard to the liberalisation of direct marketing advertising .
in so doing , Britain will hit a threefold blow , but , in particular , it applies to the shallow country , because privatisation means the end of day @-@ to @-@ day sales and access to customers in rural areas , which will have to pay higher prices for their postal services - and the end of our extensive and excellent rural postal networks network .
the report is a balanced compromise , which I hope the Council will support .
here too , in this debate , there is no room for hard @-@ liners over the necessary European construction to conceal the timidity and conservatism .
so where are we , ten years later ?
if we do not do enough and act too late , we are jeopardising the entire postal sector .
our proposal is carefully balanced because the universal service providers need time to make further structural changes and be more flexible so that they can adapt to the new situation of the market .
it is against this background that I can accept the amendments on which there is consensus , and I also agree with the amendments that focus on issues such as universal service in the Member States , the treatment of consumer complaints and the rural postal services network .
secondly , this issue will be on the agenda for next Friday in the Telecommunications Council .
we tried to agree with the Commission ; this was not quite successful .
contacts have been opened with the Commission and the last meeting confirms that it is maintaining its position , that is to say maintaining the quota system according to the &apos; served @-@ first &apos; procedure and the switch to the tariff only system from 2006 .
this proposal has already been accepted by Ecuador , the largest banana producers in the world and one of the advertisements of the World Trade Organisation .
I believe that the amendment tabled by Mr Vatanen , tabled by Mr Vatanen , does not help to make things easier and I invite him , if he is listening to me , to consider withdrawing it .
in this respect , I would like to point out here that banana production is not intrinsically production of the Community .
everything is regulated at the WTO .
then we will probably have a different position of power , and this should be expressed in the banana report and in the objectives we set ourselves .
both have been able to increase their production because we have offered them a market that we must not shy away from them .
finally , I would like to congratulate the rapporteur , Mr Dary , on his excellent work .
I would also like to express my thanks to the chairman of the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development , Mr Graefe zu Baringdorf , for his efforts to reach a compromise with the Commission .
this is unfair .
welcome
Mr President , I should like to express my thanks for the good support of all the political groups .
( the President declared the common position approved as amended ) ( The sitting was suspended at 12 noon for a formal sitting and resumed at 12.30 p.m. )
on the other hand , the Commission is prepared to accept Amendments Nos 1 , 2 , 3 , 5 , 11 , 12 , 13 , 14 and 15 .
this is also the approval of the honourable Member who tabled the oral amendment .
report ( A5 @-@ 0376 / 2000 ) by Mrs Theato , on behalf of the Committee on Budgetary Control , on the Commission Communication on the Protection of the Communities on the protection of the Communities &apos; financial interests - Anti @-@ fraud - strategy for an overall strategy &#91; COM (
the Commission has accepted many of the European Parliament &apos;s amendments , but the Council rejected most of them .
under the guise of legal arguments , some Members have in reality defended the tobacco industry .
we do not have the right to impose on others what they are supposed to do in their countries , which do not belong to the EU ; it is unwise to export jobs from the EU to third countries , where these products are undoubtedly produced and sold and our markets are only too happy to take over .
half a million people in Europe are dying of the consequences of smoking , and 85 % of cases of lung cancer are caused by smoking .
Mr President , I voted in favour of the Trakatellis report on which , for the period 2001 @-@ 2002 , it is known that EUR 7 500 million will be released , EUR 8.5 million for health awareness and ECU 2.2 million for the prevention of AIDS , worth 1.4 million for the prevention of pesticides and 1.3 million for pollution @-@ related diseases .
Mr President , I voted in favour of this directive on company takeovers .
it cannot therefore be the aim of this Parliament to undermine the art market in Europe and I hope that the Member States and the Commission will now adopt the common position in the conciliation procedure .
for these reasons , the non @-@ Members have refused to support the report .
moreover , both young and renowned artists will suffer as a result of international trade based on European regulation outside the borders of the European Union .
the financial resources for stabilisation operations in this region are , for example , totally inadequate in general .
the situation is alarming .
the fraudsters are going to choose between countries in which the protection is at the lowest ebb .
&apos;@@ Corpus Juris &apos; is to be established at the end of an independent European Public Prosecutor &apos; s Office , which is responsible for violations of the EU &apos;s financial interests by members of the EU institutions and by officials of the EU institutions and by third parties .
while I can protect the interests of the ACP countries at the same time , this is all the better , but I believe it is important not to lose sight of the well @-@ being of our European citizens .
in the Dary report , account has rightly been taken of banana producers both in the Community and in the ACP countries .
I can also accept Amendment No 28 if a corresponding provision on the possibility of a reduction is still included .
the Commission believes that the ten years required in Amendments Nos 11 and 13 are too long .
EU @-@ US summit
we want to ensure that priority is given to strategic issues during the two @-@ year summits , and that these issues will , if need be , be discussed not only with one person , but also in a number of meetings .
finally , we will certainly also discuss the decisions taken at the Nice Summit on the rapid reaction force of the European Union .
the most important thing will be that we carry out a consolidation , we will look very closely at how the various programmes we have begun can be seen under the umbrella of the transatlantic agenda .
the Commission is currently discussing the revival of certain elements of its position in a new trade round , and wants to make it more flexible , and I look forward to seeing what this really will mean in practice .
we cannot accept a situation whereby crimes and violence will turn a blind eye to crime and violence .
we will explain , among other things , how the various dialogues have developed .
we should vigorously defend this position without thinking that it undermines our relations with our best friends and major allies .
my military career has not been long or brilliant , but I have learned that the artillery will carry out the artillery in the bombing , as much as the enemy itself .
secondly , the delivery of digitised products is a service and not a supply of objects .
in the light of this situation , the Commission has commissioned a study under examination of what we can do .
finally , we do not like the Commission to start its term of office at the beginning of its term of office , and that Parliament , which understands the need to extend the validity of the current legislation , is still waiting for the Commission to present us with a new , complete and fundamental draft on this matter in the middle of its mandate , when the euro is already in circulation .
in this respect , I welcome the bold attempt by the Commission to find a way to close the competitive gap that appears to exist between European e @-@ commerce companies and those of third countries .
this should be encouraged as far as the shift to rail on several routes offers an equivalent alternative .
from the point of view of equality between modes of transport and competition , I think it is best for us to take the lead and introduce a tax on aviation in the European Union .
in the meantime , we all know that unfair tax competition is harmful to everyone .
however , due to the large range of VAT rates , there must be a distribution of tax revenues between Member States , as our rapporteur rightly proposes .
we need a global perspective .
it would also mean a fairer treatment of the different modes of transport .
for example , I do not understand why the introduction of the euro should require another , yes , any kind of coordination of VAT rates .
we know our key figures : a tax rate of more than 45 % achieves a large number of budgetary deficits for a large number of our Member States , and the United States &apos; key figures are different .
I would urge the Commission to reconsider the proposal and consider an alternative possibility .
coordination and harmonisation do not mean standardisation .
Mr President , it really is touching to hear the glaring calling for the promotion of electronic commerce , but the problem we have here is the real competitive disadvantage of our European companies and the correction of the situation by defining certain rules of the game that all services provided by private individuals in the European Union are taxed by electronic means .
this is exactly what we want to see for aircraft .
furthermore , this proposal - as I understand it - is in line with the principles agreed at the Economic and Finance Ministers , which are in line with the principles agreed at the Ottawa Conference in Ottawa .
if , today , the air tickets were 42 % cheaper than was the case ten years ago , it is clear that the wrong signals are being put on prices .
the public deserves better .
I do not think so .
Mr President , I consider the idea of a unilateral establishment of the tax systems for aviation fuel in the EU , in view of the fact that we are still under the umbrella of the Chicago Convention of the Chicago Convention on kerosene , which is internationally exempt from taxation at international level .
it creates legal certainty for every individual savers and citizen .
much attention has been devoted to this issue in recent months since the presentation of the Commission proposal of 7 June this year .
the existence of an objective and clear criterion , namely that of the residence of the consumer , is beneficial .
such a measure aims to simplify and regulate the exchange of information between Member States on VAT numbers in electronic commerce , and we will take account of the proposal in our further work within the framework of Parliament and the Council .
however , these negotiations will be rather difficult , since no decision has been taken at the previous conference on the possible introduction of a tax on aviation fuel .
this accident , one of many , aroused indignation and bitterness among the population concerned and the public opinion as a whole in view of the lack of transparency in the maritime transport sector and the failure to adjust the rules in force to avoid problems of this nature .
the second objective is to simplify and speed up the transfer of detailed data on dangerous or polluting cargoes in the event of a disaster , by obliging the vessels and the authorities to transmit the data to electronic means .
on the question of liability : we have to look very carefully at that .
as far as the black box is concerned , it has to be said that , as of July 2008 , the International Maritime Organisation provides for an obligation of this kind from July 2008 , and we would like this date to be brought forward .
Mr President , I too would like to thank Mrs De Palacio for her presentation .
question No 33 by ( H @-@ 08@@ 73 / 00 ) :
is it then acceptable that , when all the legal provisions have been observed in their own country , a vehicle close to the border may be stopped on the neighbouring state ?
they do not , therefore , contribute to the costs incurred in Britain to run the road network , at the same time as reducing car taxes in their own countries .
I am not in a position to give you precise figures on the volume of beef imports from third countries , but I can assure you that appropriate rules apply to these imports and that these rules are based on considerations of food safety .
Mr President , &apos; Jews are enemies of prophets and believers .
I repeat that we will follow the issue with the Palestinian authorities .
the Merger Regulation does not provide a legal basis for considering accusations of human rights violations , and therefore the Commission has no powers to investigate alleged human rights violations in this connection .
in contrast , the Member States and the European Union have other means at their disposal to be active on human rights issues .
if the Commission , within the framework of the regulation on trade barriers , cannot reach a negotiated solution with Korea to the European Union , it will also report back to the Council on 1 May 2001 and propose that the case be brought to the WTO in order to reach a decision on Korea &apos;s unfair practices .
and do not forget that Mr Valdivielso de Cué asked if the Commission believes that shipbuilding would have had a chance of survival without the aid received in the European Union .
the employment aspect has been discussed very carefully .
subject : &apos; everything but arms &apos; does the Commission think it is right that this momentous proposal - which could potentially have a major impact on the sugar beet beet farmers already under pressure in the European Union - is to be adopted without any consultation of the directly elected European Parliament ?
with regard to Mrs Kinnock &apos;s question on the link between this initiative and the Cotonou Agreement , I would like to repeat that the Commission has fully respected the spirit and the content of the provisions of this agreement in relation to the information and consultation of the ACP countries .
it is true that , at present , the price of sugar in the European Union is three times higher than on the world market , which is indeed a problem .
I cannot immediately deny the question as to whether this is a tactical approach to the positive influence of the least @-@ developed countries within the framework of a negotiating round .
one of the four organisations mentioned is that whose eligible projects in this area will be fully included in this proposal in 2001 .
Mr President , Commissioner Liikanen , we will discuss the content directive later this evening .
a new article included in the Treaty provides for a possible extension of the powers of the European Court of Justice in this regard .
I would like to receive an assurance that the Commission will look at the merits of such an approach very carefully , as I suspect that the emergence of new areas of competence might eventually break up our legal systems .
what measures will the Commission take to get the Member States that have failed to do so to set up a European brand court ?
I would like to thank Mr Berenguer Fuster for getting so forcefully to the Commission on this subject .
Commissioner , I must confess that you have not provided me with any greater clarity or , on the contrary , as I did not know , because this complaint has been before the European Commission for a year .
thank you for your answer , Commissioner .
in this case , it is a British qualification .
question No 49 by ( H @-@ 09@@ 12 / 00 ) :
there are now more well @-@ established ships and carriers who are looking for the place of those who are now taking their service and who should be connected with one another .
Mr President , I welcome this initiative from the Commission .
the implementation of the programme must therefore be shortened because , with more funding for a shorter period of time , the effects can also be increased .
I would like to know all the meaning of the term &apos; content &apos; .
there are no longer any limits to the transmission of digital information .
the Group of the European People &apos;s Party ( Christian Democrats ) and European Democrats will support the suggestions made here - and I thank Mrs Gill for this - and I hope that this agreement with the Liberals and other groups will be followed up by a firm commitment to actually increasing this line of budget line as we have proposed .
the much @-@ praised cultural and linguistic diversity of Europe is , in fact , often an obstacle , especially for the common market .
that is why the programme and the report are extremely important , and I would like to congratulate the Commission and Commissioner Liikanen and Mrs Gill on this .
we must create a coherent environment in Europe .
the remaining 11 amendments are incompatible with the objectives of this particular programme or would go beyond the objectives that are achievable with the corresponding financial resources .
however , I would like to recommend that the Group of the European People ’ s Party ( Christian Democrats ) and European Democrats should block itself against the possibility of holding a debate on it this evening .
( Parliament rejected the report back to committee )
as we have heard in the debate , the principle of subsidiarity is a key element , and the Committee on the Environment , Public Health and Consumer Protection would like to see this principle respected too .
although environmental noise has grown considerably as a result of increased mobility , now a lot more people are being faced with it .
the rapporteur has suggested far higher percentages , but the fact is that environmental noise is an important and serious environmental problem .
the rapporteur has developed the highly creative idea of a framework directive , of daughter directives and of public access to information in the form of noise maps .
this directive contains useful and important proposals , such as harmonisation , use of European indices and parameters , software and so on .
in Spain and many other Mediterranean countries , the normal working day goes much further than the level of the ECU 7 o &apos;clock in this directive .
we will have to go further down this road , but the proposal put forward by the rapporteur goes too far at the moment .
on the one hand , we must have a framework directive in which measurement methods and action plans are laid down which , on the whole , establish a standardisation of policy in this field .
I would like to know what the outcome of the debate was .
we will think about what the standards have to be set after we have evaluated the strategic noise maps .
the Commission can accept Amendments Nos 3 :
it has to be said here that the treatment of algae carries the risk of misleading the consumer , because the food can come back than is actually the case .
I think that would be important for public health without in any way having a negative impact on industry .
secondly , where is the willingness of industry to come forward and say that some of the many additives we have can be scrapped ?
animal nutrition inspections
at the trilogue , it became clear that the Council is not prepared to make concessions on this issue .
but how can we give guarantees when it is not checked ?
we must be wary of not using a hierarchical approach to something that should be a citizens &apos; initiative .
the programme for renewing the cities and villages is an essential component of rural development .
in particular , in the case of cities , the concept of sustainable development cannot be limited to the environmental components but also to social and economic aspects .
better knowledge and modern technology offer an opportunity to improve the environment in Europe ’ s cities .
it will enable cities and communities in Europe and beyond , help to build contacts and learn from the experience of others to help them meet environmental problems and challenges and work for sustainability .
the second question concerns comitology .
Mr President , Commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , we are dealing here , certainly at something later , with the famous precautionary principle .
the text of the Committee on the Environment , Public Health and Consumer Protection is the result of constant compromise , or rather a conciliation between the maximalist and minimalist demands represented by our debate , both of which run counter to extreme excesses .
we need to make sure that this report distorts the public ’ s demands for a high level of health and environment protection .
caution is always available when the risks are well known .
I am therefore pleased to note that the final report reflects the need for further adherence to the concept .
it proposes reversing the burden of proof for products without prior authorization , which means that producers must provide proof of the safety of their products and should not leave the price to consumers and costs .
we know that our whole life is characterised by risks and uncertainties .
on the other hand , the European Union itself is doing little in a very clear and even irrational way .
however , there are more examples than BSE , for example , which is perhaps not so spectacular , but it is at least as important to take decisions .
the analysis of the advantages and disadvantages is an absurd idea , given that the basic idea behind the precautionary principle is to be able to react before the advantages and disadvantages are fully known .
the precautionary principle was also discussed at the Nice Summit , which noted a resolution adopted by the General Affairs Council .
it is important to emphasise here that the decision @-@ makers have the same level of protection .
it strongly condemns ETA &apos; s crimes in Spain and calls on the European Union institutions to take effective action to combat terrorism .
( loud and sustained applause )
the unelected nationalist officials are murdered , as is entrepreneurs , journalists , public prosecutors , or ordinary citizens who , in some cases , have objected to the intended imposition of independence .
however , I am , of course , dependent on the input of the services .
we will grant you this fatherhood .
before the vote on Amendment 51
( Parliament adopted the resolution )
I am not convinced by the statement that important Swiss environmental organisations would have voted for the idea of financing the proceeds from road pricing to the development of rail .
I am pleased that it has now been recognised .
in Luxembourg , there is to be no more technical services , such as printing and translation services .
the 2001 budget is largely based on a compromise between Parliament , the Council and the Commission , which we support .
thus , the European Union , albeit rather late in its day , recognises the importance of providing substantial aid to the difficult Republic of Yugoslavia , while respecting its borders .
this is a remarkably weak conclusion .
through a gradual liberalisation of the European market , postal services can be more effective and provide better service to customers .
how will the postal sector survive this time of pleas , with contradictions and controversy within the framework of the often technical debate in order to open up competition to competition ?
the price and weight limits are defined wisely , that is to say that up to 150 grams will remain reserved for the universal service , with a price limit amounting to four times the public tariffs .
the Commission &apos;s proposal in the postal services allows for a total liberalisation , which is aimed at a universal service as well as the companies that provide it and the workers who export it .
the European Parliament therefore sends a clear signal to the Commission , which has reservations about the complete liberalisation of the postal market .
in this way , the European Union &apos;s funds should not be spent !
we have neither the intention to favour the large shark of the banana sector or the smaller sharks in the zone protected by Europe .
the European Convention on Human Rights provides a framework for restricting consumer protection .
the content programme aims to promote the development and use of European digital content in global networks and to promote linguistic diversity in the information society .
in the digital field , sponsoring is at the same time a competitive edge , a line of argument and a good legal position for those who speak their mother tongue .
on the other hand , I hope that the Intergovernmental Conference scheduled for 2004 , which I believe will be the only positive outcome of Nice , will once and for all treat the division of competences between the European Union and the governments of the Member States .
the Nice European Council had a positive view of the fact that the decision on the new weighting of votes and the new allocation of Members of the European Parliament , with the involvement of the Eastern European countries , gave them a strong signal that they were willing to accept them as soon as possible .
despite a slight increase in the threshold of qualified majority , the scope of which needs to be reviewed , this extension will probably mean widening the gap between the European institutions and the national democracies .
several Members of the European Parliament have been very committed to enlargement of the agenda .
we still have a few months before the end of 2003 to save the European project .
despite the successful efforts of the Nice Summit in this area , the resolution expresses dissatisfaction with the new extension of the scope of qualified majority voting .
on the contrary , the citizens of Europe and their Parliament are experiencing a &apos; step backwards in Amsterdam &apos; .
so far , no other summit has had to deal with the prospect of such a comprehensive enlargement .
nothing will be done to make the EU more democratic or to strengthen the power of national parliaments .
we pensioners travel a great deal and , to be honest , it is easy to travel with the railways or the car ; the aircraft for us is a dream that becomes a reality .
&quot; I shall walk on foot .
this approach must be supported because the gap between developed and backward regions is much greater in technological development than in GDP .

that is why the innovation factors , however modest they may be , should be underrated by nobody .
however , these technologies , in particular , are now giving them the means to catch up , provided that economic operators in the regions are also able to implement innovative measures to exploit these opportunities .
to avoid any inconsistency , this call , Commissioner , must be accompanied by a limitation of the exhausting administrative burdens at all stages of the procedure - from being included in the programmes to their implementation .
it was particularly good that , in particular , women were involved in the subject of new technologies .
if the 1999 reform of the seven years set aside for the 2000 @-@ 2006 period , for the 2000 @-@ 2006 period , were reduced by 50 % as a result of our complex institutionalisation , we should not be surprised when it has to be said that not even the budget earmarked for the innovative policies of regional policy could not even be spent on the current year , which is politically irresponsible .
on the main points which were laid down , and which I presented personally to the Committee on Regional Policy on 11 September , I should like to point out that these innovative measures are primarily a tool for regional development .
we have , in fact , taken up a number of points in order to help small and medium @-@ sized enterprises find solutions to their knowledge and staff requirements in the data processing sector .
I must , as you too must , be content with the resources provided for in the Berlin guidelines and the package of Agenda 2000 .
in the 2000 procurement contracts , which date , South Korea has been able to draw on more than 40 % of new reconstruction contracts to South Korea , on the basis of loans from Southern Korean banks , some of which are state @-@ owned banks , on the basis of state guarantees that amount to subsidy .
I hope that the election date for the presentation of this report in Parliament was not a ploy to persuade us to delete this item from the agenda .
we have also , above all , taken note of the Council ’ s conclusions of 5 December and the Council has accepted that it would do something for the future by being firm towards South Korea and denying the possibility of resuming the support for shipbuilding in certain sectors that are particularly affected by Korean competition in May .
I believe that Europe is in fact exposed to unfair competition , because in Korea , very low wages are paid , and the working conditions for Korean workers are devastating , and European workers will not be able to compete with them in these conditions .
such a transparent form of support measures is not an incentive for European shipyards to use all kinds of non @-@ market procedures to reduce production capacity or marketing methods .
at the moment , where shipyards were , today a stadium or a marine museum etc. had some 4 000 jobs in the shipyards .
Mr President , I would like to begin my speech by congratulating Mr Langen on the quality of his report .
following this failure , a complaint was lodged in October of this year in accordance with the regulation on trade barriers and , on 4 December , Commissioner Lamy announced the Commission &apos;s decision to launch an inquiry .
this would be proposed if no satisfactory agreement with Korea can be reached in the course of the examining procedure initiated in accordance with the regulation on trade barriers .
he was a worker , and like the one who survived the award of the Sakharov Prize yesterday , he was a faceless citizen who served the democratic system that we had democratically elected .
after all , it was an English nuclear submarine with the right name .
ladies and gentlemen , this is not scaremongering .
in both these countries , we call on the Commission to examine the scope of the existing treaties to see how they can participate in this matter .
this is how we have seen a number of inconsistencies over these months .
she regrets that it cannot be here to answer questions personally , because they are taking part in Brussels in order to prepare for next week &apos;s important ministerial meetings on climate change .
in response to the question of whether there is an intervention plan for the territory of Gibraltar and the port of Gibraltar , the British authorities have drawn the attention of the Commission to the public safety plan of Gibraltar , where the English title names &apos; contain food safety &apos; , and the plan for intervention in Gibraltar .
the first point I would like to make is that repairs in the cold system of these submarines are already under way .
the submarine problem must be resolved calmly and across @-@ the @-@ board cooperation between all the interested and competent authorities .
perhaps this is a serious matter , and perhaps not .
we are pleased that this is the only thing that distinguishes us .
this situation cannot be a bilateral issue between two states that belong to political union .
the interests of the people of Gibraltar and the south of the south of the South East are entirely the same in this respect .
the Spanish Government has , from the outset , adopted a position based on two conditions : the need for transparent information based on scientific and technical criteria to assess the extent of repairs and their hazards , and also that any decision , whether or not to repair the submarines in Gibraltar or converting the British Isles , will be dealt with under strict technical criteria .
B5 @-@ 09@@ 01 / 2000 by Mr Sylla and others , on behalf of the GUE / NGL Group ;
it is not , therefore , an anniversary , but rather the emergency that the UN Refugee Agency is experiencing .
however , this is not enough , on the contrary , we need to support the UNHCR politically and financially in order to ensure the traceability , flexibility and geographical balance .
anyone who has been at the exhibition recently in the European Parliament , listening to the images and the texts on the current activities of the UNHCR around the world , will agree that this was one of the saddest exhibitions we have ever faced in Parliament .
these meetings are intended to help the Commission provide the UNHCR with the necessary financial resources in a more reliable and transparent manner , as the Office has been calling for for a long time , while supporting the UNHCR in improving aid for those who need it .
B5 @-@ 09@@ 02 / 2000 by Morgantini and Frahm , on behalf of the GUE / NGL Group ;
that is a second problem .
the new political leadership in Serbia must take action - and this , Mr President , I would like to stress - is that the former President and dictator Milosevic , together with his hand , would like him to be brought before the International Criminal Court in The Hague .
we expect either to have a clear law in favour of a short @-@ term amnesty , with concrete details or , preferably in combination with , a precise date for the release of political prisoners .
so much has changed since the autumn : the new authorities in Belgrade have acted quickly to restore international contacts ; they have acted quickly to allow the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia to resume its place at the United Nations and also its place in the OSCE .

at some point General Pinochet came to the idea of travelling to Europe , and when he arrived in Europe , the European judicial authorities tried to get General Pinochet responsible for his actions .
I also confirm the support of our group for the amendment tabled by the Confederal Group of the European United Left - Nordic Green Left on the military intervention of the military .
the peaceful and democratic pursuit of political objectives is not only a means to an end ; it is part of a worthwhile objective .
as long as the situation is that country will not be able to negotiate about EU membership .
I am looking forward to seeing a hunger strike , as far as he is not a crude deceit , as a suicidal venture that would allow me to promote my personal conviction .
some of them , such as relatives , for example , are in a critical state .
although a number of passports have been returned , even though President Ben Ali has made a speech on freedom of the press and improving prison conditions , we note a serious deterioration in the human rights situation in Tunisia .
at least 1 000 people are still imprisoned for their beliefs .
the young student is on hunger strike since 18 October .
I was present a week before she was placed under the supervision of justice in the Human Rights League .
( the President cut off the speaker )
in addition to what has happened in public statements , the use of force has been deplored in public statements , and measures have been advocated with those brought before the courts who bear the responsibility for doing so .
with regard to the finances - and this relates directly to the important remark made here - an area in which we have already gathered a number of experiences in other countries , the Commission representatives in Tunis intensify their efforts to tackle two programmes in the near future , in support of journalists and support for non @-@ governmental organisations .
the continuation of this policy can only lead to bloodshed , as we have seen in other countries .
we would like them to have the courage to stand and make no effort to help them .
in order for them to be able to find a way out of the present situation , the conditions must be created in order to be able to carry out such elections in a climate of peace and reconciliation .
Mr Ouattara is not a marketable nationality , and it is quite normal , as is the case in each of our States , that Côte d &apos;Ivoire excludes those who do not have Côte d &apos;Ivoire nationals from national responsibility .
it points out during the debate on the British submarine in Gibraltar that the document on the public safety plan of Gibraltar will be made available to Members of this House .
Mr President , I would like to follow the example of Mr Wurtz and formally withdraw our resolution .
I am aware that we are facing another debate on this issue .
I take your point of order as an invitation to diligence .
we are well aware that health is not an unknown commodity .
in the light of this issue , the UN proclaimed the elderly , and I think it is important that it is now being considered by many quarters how the situation of older people , for example , will develop in future in the countries of the European Union .
these were exceptions , because most people died due to the miserable living conditions in relatively young years .
European institutions have few powers in this policy area .
people need mutual care and care ; they need each other .
they fall ill as a result of their work , they pay their pensions and health insurance contributions and pay taxes and levies .
in view of the widespread use of early retirement and the multiplicity of periods of departure during retirement age , it requires an enormous effort to re @-@ evaluate these policies , because not all of them are characterised by social sensitivity .
this is reminiscent of the debate in the 1960s when it was a question of keeping women out of jobs .
Mr President , like the rapporteur , whom I would like to say thank you , I would like to make the following observation : Europe is an ageing continent , if you look at the age pyramid .
as a member of the entire Friday Club , I belong to the ranks of Members who are present on this day as you are , and I hope that they will be successful next year as well .
on average , you will never find the adventure of working life .
there is an urgent need for concrete measures and specific programmes for the different groups of the elderly .
we are certainly facing enormous challenges .
not everyone can or should shut out of the labour market voluntarily .
( laughter and applause )
therefore , the date of the entry into force of the regulation should be combined with the date of the adoption of the implementing regulation , so that the funds available in 2001 will not be lost .
first , the health value of agricultural products : more fruit , more milk , to name but a few .
we want to remain healthy and food is the basis for healthy life .
from this point of view , the European Union and the Member States need to jointly contribute to information and promotion measures to help restore the value of agriculture to consumers and to gain recognition for the outstanding quality of the vast majority of our agricultural products .
or when it is mentioned that we have a deficit in the area of protein supply .
it is quite right that it should not be a matter for the taxpayers and the Union to fund advertising campaigns which , for example , are intended to promote the purchase of champions or the increased use of apples .
the expenditure under the last programme fell between 1997 and 1998 .
he is right to say that the common agricultural policy should not just relate to food , but to the social objective of keeping as many people as possible in the countryside as possible .
the last group of amendments which the Commission cannot accept are in line with the amendments that are not in line with the proposal that might have undesirable consequences , and which propose administrative procedures that do not correspond to normal practice .
it is true that there is a need , but also the right to advertise the European agricultural model .
even the Holy Benedict forced his monks to drink a quarter of wine in order to instil a quarter of wine in order to invigorate their spirit and give them a boost .
I think it is quite terrible , it is contrary to the letter of the Treaty , and I hope that this will not happen !
