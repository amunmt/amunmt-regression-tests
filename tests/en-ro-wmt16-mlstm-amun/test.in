UN Chief Says There Is No Military S@@ olution in Syria
Secretary @-@ General Ban Ki @-@ moon says his response to Russia &apos;s stepped up military support for Syria is that &quot; there is no military solution &quot; to the nearly five @-@ year conflict and more weapons will only worsen the violence and misery for millions of people .
the U.N. chief again urged all parties , including the divided U.N. Security Council , to unite and support inclusive negotiations to find a political solution .
ban told a news conference Wednesday that he plans to meet with foreign ministers of the five permanent council nations - the U.S. , Russia , China , Britain and France - on the sidelines of the General Assembly &apos;s ministerial session later this month to discuss Syria .
he expressed regret that divisions in the council and among the Syrian people and regional powers &quot; made this situation un@@ solv@@ able . &quot;
ban urged the five permanent members to show the solidarity and unity they did in achieving an Iran nuclear deal in addressing the Syria crisis .
8 Poll N@@ umbers That Show Donald Trump Is For Real
some have tried to label him a flip @-@ fl@@ opper .
others have dismissed him as a joke .
and some are holding out for an impl@@ osion .
but no matter how some Republicans are trying to drag Donald Trump down from atop the polls , it hasn &apos;t worked ( yet ) .
ten of the last 11 national polls have shown Donald Trump &apos;s lead at double digits , and some are starting to ask seriously what it means for the real estate mogul &apos;s nomination chances .
of course , it &apos;s still early in the election cycle .
none of this is to say that Trump is likely to win the Republican nomination .
pundits point out that at this time in 2011 , Rick Perry &apos;s lead was giving way to a rising Herman Cain , neither of whom won even one state in the nomination process .
and there are many reasons he would struggle in a general election .
but outside groups like Jeb Bush &apos;s Super PAC and the economic conservative group Club for Growth are recognizing Trump &apos;s staying power and beginning to un@@ load their dollars to topple him .
here are some recent poll numbers that suggest that the real estate mogul isn &apos;t just a passing phase :
Trump &apos;s favor@@ ability ratings have turned 180 degrees .
right before Donald Trump announced his candidacy in mid @-@ June , a Mon@@ mouth University poll showed only two in 10 Republicans had a positive view of the real estate mogul .
by mid @-@ July , it was 40 percent .
in early August , it was 52 percent .
now , six in 10 Republicans have a favorable view of Donald Trump .
roughly three in 10 say they have a negative view .
and these numbers hold up in early states .
a Quinnipiac poll in Iowa last week found that 60 percent of Republicans there had a favorable view of Trump .
two @-@ thirds of GOP voters would be happy with Trump as the nominee .
in a CNN / ORC poll last week , 67 percent of Republicans said they would be either &quot; enthusiastic &quot; or &quot; satisfied &quot; if Trump were the nominee .
only two in 10 say they would be &quot; upset &quot; if he were the nominee .
only Ben Carson generates roughly the same level of enthusiasm as Trump ( 43 percent say they would be &quot; enthusiastic &quot; vs. 40 percent who say the same of Trump ) .
the next closest in enthusiasm ?
Marco Rubio with only 21 percent .
on the flip side , 47 percent of Republican voters say they would be &quot; dissatisfied &quot; or &quot; upset &quot; if establishment favorite Jeb Bush becomes the nominee .
a majority of Republicans don &apos;t see Trump &apos;s temperament as a problem .
while Donald Trump has been widely criticized for his bomb@@ ast and insults , 52 percent of leaned Republican voters nationwide think that the real estate mogul has the right temperament to be president , according to Monday &apos;s ABC News / Washington Post poll .
the same number holds in the first @-@ in @-@ the @-@ nation caucus state of Iowa , where the same 52 percent of Republicans think he has the personality to be commander in chief , according to Quinnipiac last week .
still , 44 percent think he doesn &apos;t have the personality to serve effectively , and almost six in 10 independents say his temperament does not belong in the White House , according to ABC / Post .
Republican voters are getting used to the idea .
when they put on their pundit hats , Republican voters think Trump is for real .
when asked who is most likely to win the GOP nomination , four in 10 said Trump was the best bet , according to a CNN / ORC poll out last week .
that &apos;s a change from when four in 10 placed their money on Jeb Bush in late July .
full disclosure : GOP voters haven &apos;t had the clearest crystal ball in the past .
at this time last cycle , four in 10 Republicans picked Rick Perry to win the nomination , vs. only 28 percent for eventual nominee Mitt Romney .
still , it shows that a plurality of GOP voters see Trump &apos;s campaign as plausible .
even if Republicans rallied around another candidate , Trump still beats almost everyone .
some pundits point out that the spl@@ intere@@ d field is likely contributing to Trump &apos;s lead , while anti @-@ Trump support is be spread dif@@ fus@@ ely among more than a dozen other candidates .
but a Mon@@ mouth University poll in early September shows that , in a hypothetical head @-@ to @-@ head matchup between Trump and most other Republican candidates , Trump almost always gar@@ ners majority support .
he leads Carly Fiorina by 13 points , Marco Rubio by 14 points , Walker by 15 points , Jeb Bush by 19 points , and , finally , Rand Paul , John Kasich and Chris Christie by 33 points each .
he &apos;s in a dead heat with Ted Cruz .
the only candidate who beats him ?
Ben Carson would lead the businessman by a wide 19 points in a hypothetical head @-@ to @-@ head .
a bare majority of Donald Trump &apos;s supporters say they &apos;ve made up their minds .
a new CBS / NYT poll out on Tuesday shows that just more than half of voters who support Trump say they have locked in their votes .
obviously , a lot can happen to change that , and no one can really say they would never change their mind .
46 percent said they are leaving the door open to switching candidates .
still , Trump &apos;s strongest competition at the moment is from fellow outsider neurosurgeon Ben Carson , but voters who say they have made up their minds are twice as likely to go for Trump .
six in 10 Republicans say they agree with Trump on immigration .
even since Donald Trump called immigrants from Mexico &quot; rapists &quot; in his campaign announcement speech two months ago , immigration has been front and center in the 2016 conversation .
some are worried that Trump &apos;s bomb@@ ast will drive crucial Hispanic voters away from the Republican Party and damage rebranding efforts .
but according to Monday &apos;s new ABC / Post poll , six in 10 Republicans say they agree with Trump on immigration issues .
so as long as immigration remains in the spotlight , it seems Donald Trump will remain too .
frustration with government is climbing to new highs .
Donald Trump and Ben Carson now account for roughly half of the support from Republican voters , largely due to their outsider status .
six in 10 Republicans in Monday &apos;s new ABC / Post poll say they want a political outsider over someone with government experience .
and they are angry at Washington , too .
a Des Moines Register / Bloomberg poll in Iowa from two weeks ago shows that three in four Iowa Republicans are frustrated with Republicans in Congress , with 54 percent &quot; un@@ satisfied &quot; and 21 percent &quot; mad as hell . &quot;
Jeremy Corbyn to make debut at Prime Minister &apos;s Questions
since his election , Mr Corbyn &apos;s debut at PMQs has been keenly awaited
new Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn is to make his debut at Prime Minister &apos;s Questions later , taking on David Cameron for the first time .
Mr Corbyn will rise to ask the first of his six allotted questions shortly after midday , with his performance likely to be closely scrutinised by the media and Labour MPs .
he has called for &quot; less theatre and more facts &quot; at the weekly showpiece .
he has also said he could skip some sessions , leaving them to colleagues .
the encounter will be the first parliamentary test of Mr Corbyn &apos;s leadership , coming after his appointment of a shadow cabinet and his speech to the TUC annual congress on Tuesday .
meanwhile , the Labour leader &apos;s decision to stand in silence during the singing of the national anthem at a service on Tuesday to mark the 75th anniversary of the Battle of Britain has attracted criticism from a number of Tory MPs and is the focus of several front page stories in the newspapers .
Mr Corbyn &apos;s decision not to sing the national anthem has attracted attention
a spokesman for Mr Corbyn said he had &quot; stood in respectful silence &quot; and did recognise the &quot; heroism of the Royal Air Force in the Battle of Britain . &quot;
but a member of Mr Corbyn &apos;s shadow cabinet , Owen Smith , told BBC Two &apos;s Newsnight programme he would have advised the Labour leader to sing the national anthem &quot; irrespective &quot; of his belief that the monarchy should be abolished .
nearly a dozen shadow ministers have refused to serve in Mr Corbyn &apos;s top team , citing differences over the economy , defence and foreign affairs , while less than a sixth of the parliamentary party originally backed him as leader .
BBC political correspondent Robin Br@@ ant says policy differences are also &quot; stacking up &quot; within Labour following Mr Corbyn &apos;s appointment over its position on the European Union and the government &apos;s cap on benefits .
Mr Corbyn told the TUC conference Labour was putting forward amendments to remove the whole idea of a cap altogether .
hours later Mr Smith , the shadow work and pensions secretary , said the party was &quot; very clear &quot; that it was only opposing government plans to reduce the level of cap from £ 26,000 to £ 23,000 .
Mr Corbyn will be the fifth Labour leader that David Cameron has faced across the desp@@ atch box over the past decade since he became Tory leader .
the Labour leader , who has promised a different approach to politics , says he has &quot; crowd sourced &quot; ideas for questions to ask Mr Cameron and has been given more than 30,000 suggestions .
the Islington North MP has said PMQs is too confrontational and that he will refrain from both &quot; repart@@ ee &quot; and trading barb@@ s , instead vowing to focus on serious issues such as poverty , inequality and the challenges facing young people .
Mr Corbyn has said that Angela Eagle , the shadow business secretary , will deput@@ ise for him at PMQs when he does not attend - for instance when Mr Cameron is travelling abroad .
he has also floated the idea of allowing other colleagues to take the floor on occasion , saying he had approached the Commons Speaker John Bercow to discuss the issue .
when he became leader in 2005 , Mr Cameron said he wanted to move away from the &quot; P@@ unch and Judy &quot; style of politics often associated with PMQs but admitted some years later that he had failed .
since it was first televised in 1990 , PMQs has been seen as a key barometer of a leader &apos;s judgement , their command of the Commons and their standing among their fellow MPs although critics have argued it has become a caricature and is in need of far @-@ reaching reforms .

JD Sports boss says higher wages could hurt expansion
JD Sports Executive Chairman Peter Cow@@ gill says a higher minimum wage for UK workers could mean &quot; more spending power in the pockets of potential consumers . &quot;
but that spending power is unlikely to outweigh the higher labour costs at his firm , he says .
the costs could hit JD Sports &apos; expansion plans , he added , which could mean fewer extra jobs .
Thanasi Kokkinakis backed by Tennis Australia president Steve Healy
